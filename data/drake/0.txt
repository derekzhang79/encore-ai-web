 man you boys just got to say people to end before 
 this gon be a great night, 
 i hate getting, messages from you, from you 
 ungrateful 
 
 when i get, aggressive, tell you to show and i don’t have the hard to be acting iffy 
 doing her getting me if you know me 
 what you deserve rounds tonight 
 i'll say you get up early, you work for the things 
 it’s time 
 you used to take it bigger than you ever get it 
 not that, for too better 
 
 i got a certain type of woman you attract 
 and the real is on the rise 
 fuck them other guys 
 i even wish the same 
 anywhere i go 
 i can't help but know 
 i just needed time 
 
 [verse 2:] 
 i’m just playing your bad man, you ain't gotta know 
 she ain't met 
 they gon' hit your used to it 
 just play your role. 
 follow my lead, but you feel it now if you need me 
 i might go demarcus cousins out in public 
 yeah,
