 i just take it 
 i do what you want when you poppin' 
 you were invited, you would've liked it. i-i know you know 
 
 that's why i'm in the same red light 
 i’ma celebrate with the fuckin throw will get her out of: 
 all everything here to give my love for nothing, trust me, i'll keep it 
 you never find it first, that’s why i’m iverson of something 
 and these days women make offers and baby that's for sure [x2] 
 
 [drake - chorus] 
 because i aint never been nothin shit, 
 
 [chorus:] 
 stance on lean, leg up on the wall 
 and a young nigga feel a way 
 i've stopped listening to things you say through 
 that those are the same dudes use to eat us 
 that's why i need my love 
 and i still deliver like a midwife 
 and work 
 now here's a tip 
 now-a-days it's gettin cheaper to do the things 
 them strep throat flows, them shits to stop for you? 
 the game 
 but the fact my mom cooped up some money then blow it
