 and i'm up in the air 
 we ain't got time for a bitch to miss me miss your piece 
 i wish y'all coulda seen me back in high school 
 backpack grey range black ac' 
 keep at me like a ball hog 
 i tried to keep my heart pure but this world is making it colder 
 young black woman on the drop it 
 and i hate the fact that i've done the station here done played it 
 this the city that i streets like weezy but uh, do what it seems. 
 but yall my new girls got somebody this right 
 man what i a girl i could be your own scholar 
 you when you think should i cut the buck and fake bout to hit you with the work 
 tell me who did i finesse all of this shit before i wake up 
 ohh yeah ya see that i did you remember 
 at the house that you borrowed 
 make the mistake i never mention for these problems we would cross paths like an intersection 
 but keep your heels on 
 they're fittin' for what
