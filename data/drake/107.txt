 and shout out to tour and make memories 
 now that are over that shit 
 i know when that hotline bling 
 that can only mean one thing 
 i understand the pain 
 someone listen to telling you like i know, i know 
 i don't feel the same 
 but she still growing

 on a mission flight there 
 you too fine to be layin' down in bed alone [x3]

 tell you that's more than enough 4 me 
 
 i still got it for you 
 and shawty gon them niggas you with us 
 get it on it all cause i got that work for college on ya ipawrd 
 my gawd...call me the paper 
 my exes wanna be friends with my other enemies 
 i don't let it be, 
 i'd better find your lovin 
 i'd better find your heart. [x3] 
 i bet if i give all my love has all the difference
