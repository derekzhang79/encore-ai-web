 i got her tripping off of smart decisions 
 i'm on the last girl 
 i just can't explain this sh-t at all fall for your type (ohhohh) 
 for your type.

 but all this dick out here 
 started from the bottom now my whole team here, nigga 
 started from the bottom now we here

 somebody somewhere just really iâ€™m always chasing your mind 
 she call me the game mind

 bring some ice for my own 
 and make the connection 
 'cause i swear i heard your man's not a given 
 gon' pull your lane my girl 
 i need your company 
 i've only been 3 on my own
