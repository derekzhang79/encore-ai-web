 jumpman, jumpman, jumpman they said, party tonight 
 they know, they know, they all get what they desire i want to 
 it all worked out girl, we shoulda put the name on her tongue, 
 i can't be on my mind lately she distracting me, 
 wondering if i went missin’ on yo ass, throwin every president except for real, most of these are grown tired 
 really i'm the plug, really i'm the king on it right now 
 but it's too late 'cause i'm gettin every just ever know 
 it’s hard, either (ah)

 come thru girl you deserve it 
 get a plastic bag 
 go ahead and pick up all the cash 
 you danced all on my old name 
 only gets worse when you know things
