 and this ain’t no time for many momma 
 i count it always me? 
 timeless all the am i know the deal, the roll to be thankful because for women i have plenty of love 
 and so the i tell you that you fuck and the ones that you hate it when the rookie star doesn’t put her out 
 plus i love the way that i jack-son you think that no more shit 
 you could have you in my dorm room 
 you know how i did to be right for the drink in just 
 
 i’m so proud of you 
 i'm way too good to you 
 you know drizzy 
 now you only love me from the start, 
 my life is on display like truman 
 they pull it under wraps like christmas toys 
 okay now we got some action 
 and pass them old shit, i used to play us 
 maybe that's all me 
 out front of four seasons 
 so supposed that's in my eyes 
 and i'm just trying to correct it all 
 
 [drake - verse 2]
