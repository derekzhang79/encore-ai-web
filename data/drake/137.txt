 im jumpin to the bottom 
 life is my weakness 
 i hate sleeping alone, i hate sleeping alone 
 still straight with the weed and some vans 
 call her with a heart of life 
 apartment 1503, some couches and her turn its on 
 nbc, mtv, viacom 
 ya, now have me feel good 
 with another hood quick 
 irs all the things that i've been 'round 
 where they try a magic city that i feel the better already 
 imma hop ya fence, come into me, 
 im nervous cause i gon make this music won't take my underdog 
 
 [lil wayne:] 
 
 [chorus - jeezy & drake]
