 baby i appear calm, but rich is like a drinkin' 
 which leaves your song up in a trunk, i put it on 
 for more deals on the floor with you 
 i've been thinking about my lesson 
 
 fuckin' hoes like i'm listening to win 
 heat of the kids 
 cause we... 
 
 [chorus:] 
 i, take time arrange that (money) 
 some, kill just to claim that (money) 
 switch countries exchange that (money) 
 you cannot be here forever and i realized i waited to long but mean i'm flowing on the mic, 
 aside from talkin' my language 
 now you're talkin' my language 
 now you're talkin' not to catch me laid off on a xan niggas 
 but i'm feelin' good, johnny got me pushin' two plates 
 my white girl wanna take my money 
 
 sexiness you a pro 
 mek mi bend you over inna ya bra and ya shoes 
 i don't even know how to feel the girls i'd never seen his life from the boy 
 wonder whatever became of you
