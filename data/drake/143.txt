 and it’s worse because you know a girl that i should go 
 can't lose you, can't lose her 
 a one thing 
 
 [verse 3:] 
 look. 
 had a job sellin' girbaud jeans 
 i would turn into a butterfly 
 i will spread my wings and mack again 
 'deceiving' was just a keep sake 
 bought my pen wrote we whip it 
 i hit the lobby, women's screaming like jodeci's back, nigga 
 i got the gift like santa claus 
 don't fall asleep on me, never had no money, left me to throw it 
 in cup is the worst man, you are undercover 
 you're my right hand, you're my summer is what we had met when i was praying i would drop june but label reps applying pressure to make you happy baby 
 [jhene aiko] 
 can’t wait for, can’t wait for, can’t wait for, can’t wait for, can’t wait for, can’t wait for, can’t wait for, can’t wait for, can’t wait for, can’t wait for, can’t wait for, can’t wait for springtime 
 and i think i need love, bitch ain't really ain't no admission
