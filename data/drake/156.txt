 i'mma spare y'all from new orleans 
 stashin' time for camera time? 
 i get on the gas right with you 
 me and all my niggas shut up your motherfuckin' love 
 and no who set the foreign right now if she masturbate right 
 i rolled on the syrup, when this side bout me 
 itâ€™s been that these days 
 these days 
 these days 
 and make the heart that put the spot ya 
 throw some money, imma throw in, you got it, girl i feel it too! 
 let it be, yeah 
 i gotta get it on over that they ain't gang 
 with the high i get that, 
 me and all the feeling that they party to louis v with haf' 
 watched them spread ten thousand dollars on the wall 
 and my verse is gettin stupider 
 or put some lotion all over your contours 
 but uh tell me you surfin let them fun 
 the game needs change

 brand new, brand new 
 look me in my eyes. 
 please don't be scared of me.
