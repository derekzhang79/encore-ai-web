 they're fittin' for what will do 
 
 but you love me straight a little bit in patience and action 
 i swear 
 i wish i had resisted these days 
 these days 
 these days 
 i cant tell you that other shit is good, and i king up too strong 
 you know i had to respect it 
 if i was in the club 
 instead of the other night 
 and over i just like my sidekick, i just don't fade through this shit, it's simple 
 instead behind these old hand prints on it 
 i ain't got the juice like " 
 its on [x6] 
 you niggas when they hide it 
 hate when i give ya niggas, is just a rapper 
 tryna sell these story so good at taking direction 
 i care in it 
 you don't have no award for that 
 trophies, trophies 
 and you wouldn't hit the escape key 
 and mommy i'ma support her, you tell your iâ€™m the show when it was you 
 i wonder whatever became of it
