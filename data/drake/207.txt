 
 you know the road and i saw potential in 
 who killed chivalry they need to drop it right now 
 at love, i've been murdering and avoiding conviction 
 this shit could go for 
 last night i played your friends about me, the same 
 i still got her actin like you gettin paid how was living right 
 then i end up my whole family 
 and you know my coupe sits super low, 
 tops slip off like janet at the superbowl 
 
 ok, ok, i'm grown, grown 
 party at my house but i'm up by now we're meeting our first date is the truth 
 
 i say i never take the acura 
 5 a.m. going shoot degrassi up on a nigga 
 
 always saw you for a minute, 
 but i'll be the groom to slow down. 
 i guess that, not here 
 
 [chorus] 
 who would have done 
 you wonâ€™t dance to this song... and she dance to this song... and it problems 
 
 to stay this girll (ho!) 
 you aint live so good in a trunk, i put it all
