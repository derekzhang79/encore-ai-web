 fuckin' with my drop but i'm on the bottle of a dam 
 i wonder if id be happy all of my ways 
 
 cause you're a good girl and you know it

 some, kill just to claim that (money) 
 switch countries exchange that (money)

 but you shouldn't miss 'em either, we got it after school 
 so i'm everybody's back 
 livin' at my mama’s house, we'd argue every month

 then i by this ain’t in my time for the first 
 i just can't explain this shit at
