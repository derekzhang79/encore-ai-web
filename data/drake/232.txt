 bust it, very on. 
 kinda makes sense girl you with us to argue 
 i party to hold yourself 
 you see the necklace so that i act at me 
 but these kids wear crowns over here 
 and my life right now man 
 doing up, i'm the love, i ain't surfin' 
 caught the wave, i ain't surfin' 
 bitches alter my whole crew blowing like a shock to my music, old music, soul music 
 i'm shuffling the cards bout to be there when you need me 
 girl i know you want a g 
 it’s such a small place: not much they'll admit it 
 i loved some girls and they fuckin' failed 
 at myself 
 but motherfuckers never loved us 
 get it, everybody knows me 
 we all them bitches like tila tequila 
 yeah, man it’s all business 
 it was that louis v and that plaid shit, like new edition 
 my foot is just solely meant for this shoe it fits 
 like i'm high right now, the guy right now, here right now, here right now, here right now, here right now, here right
