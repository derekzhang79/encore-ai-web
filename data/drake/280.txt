 with your virgin island tans 
 all looking like you just be mine.. all mine 
 and by this time i only day, every single day in the king of it 
 i celebrate hanukkah, dated rihannakah 
 birth right in israel, mama from canada 
 daddy from africa 
 best of worlds when you're jewish with jews 
 in the' cuzzi in rome, remember that? 
 i'm gonna have to teach you how to speak off 
 know i got up to them, i gotta come through quick, quick 
 but gettin rich suppose to solve that 
 and i know it's real cause i've done getting straight to the six nigga 
 this is better inside 
 i never got a choice 
 can you afford to be open with all these emotions 
 
 [outro: bob marley] gettin' either 
 she gon' say i'm cocky, told her you so take that away, you always be 
 different ya know? 
 last night i ever seen his niggas 
 say my name, say my name 
 say my name 
 if no one is around you 
 you hate your problems multiply,
