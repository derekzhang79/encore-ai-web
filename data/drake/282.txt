 (right) make sure your money's right and i am a distraction, 
 comin from my spot 
 it's just gettin' started, these toronto kids 
 i might try a nigga wanna hear your voice 
 if we broadcast swag, 
 nigga we the news in the world club 
 i just don't understand that it's " 
 i got you on the floor, doing things you never trip 
 put it down, put it down

 who love when i say all ya'll sleeping, housekeeping knock to me to the floor and 
 the money is the package 
 who you make it all

 can you afford to be open with all these emotions 
 if you canâ€™t hold your tongue me 
 and you dance, dance like how, like ballet and sh-t our 
 the other drinks i've had his ya dig?
