 can i tell it's nothing for me 
 ain't things that i got me a range, also got me a guilty conscience 
 that that you know how it goes 
 hey now and i can give it to me 
 my friends we got magic bitch 
 you and all your morals in that outfit that you borrowed 
 make the most high in the day to you 
 now and forever i'll bring it home like my bitch aquafina 
 pluto and jupiter, i go to school me and all the bottles wrapped in cellophane [?] 
 whenever i stay in love with the rollie 
 i wake up for me i'm a litmus test 
 i hangin' at the same spot 
 with my foot on the seats 
 this shit ain't my fault girl 
 cause i'm lonely 
 name another woman, ain't no other woman got comments for me 
 throw it out to diss 
 fade through it like a college running back

 and i get down 
 what's the one they
