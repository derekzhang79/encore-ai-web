 yeah 
 last time we dated 
 
 [rihanna] 
 'cause they pass me when they got everything 
 but just, hate is so crazy and i ain't tryna have the heart to buy behind 
 
 no men off stuntin' like uh, uh, uh, uh. 
 jumpman, jumpman, jumpman 
 i always stay down 
 cause the pussy too good, drink too strong 
 girl don't mind if you just with my freshman boys 
 
 [hook:] 
 it's okay my life 
 and somebody ain't around the way you need 
 next was a fucking man, you left your girl 
 say you get busy ya 
 and you do so well 
 i’m here making money transfers 
 and the leaves are turning colors 
 why, it’s just not our season 
 and i'd allow her, talk about pussy power 
 she going from the night club 
 i got that kinda... wait wait fixate! 
 which bitch the good ones go, if you wait too long 
 so i just can't explain this shit at all!
