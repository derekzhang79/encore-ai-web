 about how i have failed 
 to change all of my ways 
 
 these days 
 and if you hatin' on you with you and that drake more 
 but i bet neither are you if you listenin 
 so you need to just listen to this because look man 
 she a christian 
 my white girl wanna move back to michigan 
 i'm pullin girls i'm back up in this cell 
 thinkin' that my girl up at what i never do what you, you 
 you best believe it's yours 
 nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to my life, man i got that purple rain for the pain 
 and they know 
 they know, they know, they know 
 yeah 
 
 [chorus] 
 baby, 
 i could prolly fuck my money on a dinner being a big type 
 i hear they gotta fight with me to be thankful because for women i have plenty of love 
 you mean rosÂ©? 
 why yes it is when i turn the lights out ladies and gentleman 
 your body don't keep it break you back it up and stop 
 how much
