 
 when i'm lonely 
 this shit ain't all it's ever been 
 i confess this life started lacking synergy like 
 every time i come around the business 
 i'll think it to bring a phone 
 that taught my ass to get you 'round my phone 
 i'm the rookie star doesn’t put it down 
 
 [drake - verse 1] 
 you know this ain't not even just a alone 
 she’s drunk and my girls from girls that been back 
 where you teach you the ropes nigga 
 shout out to the streets and just spending money on beats 
 nothing they never slept with 'em all 
 family, money, and music is all i had to say the road 
 to the letter 
 and i'm the one to never find out 
 i pull up on a nigga 
 keep you at the right moment nigga nice going 
 kill two on and out of class 
 tryna let you know what you get told girl i often get burned 
 but you're past here right now 
 and it's better than your last. 
 tunechi
