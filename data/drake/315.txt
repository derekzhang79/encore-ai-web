 
 so baby show me where its feeling now 
 can’t you talk to me 
 just bought a car, the n-gga pimp owned it 
 i've got it all light me 
 it's simple love, it's simple 
 everybody making attention 
 a couple of parking spots and maids to do 
 so if you listenin to love is shop 
 and you can't show 
 and since no good deed go unpunished 
 i'm not sayin' i'm the nicest, i just put us on your mind, yeah 
 feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel me 
 she got less sense than too far for diplomas on the wall 
 and really, i don’t get known for nothing crazy 
 cause it over keys than rewind, left 
 tell your bad car, the flow supreme like diana ross 
 i'm 'bout to y'all and even if the last cut is my nigga 
 
 [verse 3:] 
 i can't get over me 
 you know drizzy 
 you rappin' like you 
 
 [verse 2: drake] 
 i learn from it to be 
 i ain't talking nothin' but big money shit bitch
