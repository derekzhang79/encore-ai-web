 special the real her poppin' out strong 
 
 so come and find me 
 just wanna take this opportunity to formally welcome you to this 
 
 brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new 
 
 show me where your heads at; maybe i can grasp it. 
 
 [hook] 
 
 [guitar break/breakdown/solo] 
 
 [outro verse] 
 i ain't never see it again 
 soon as can be, 
 i'm, i'm so indecisive 
 
 but you can work it off 
 know what you could've do 
 i wish we go 
 i can't fake in the basement 
 since jay and kelz ain't doing out for your boy 
 i need you soon, i'll be your groom 
 
 [drake:] 
 but man i ain't have sex in a long time 
 i ain't talking nothin' but big money shit 
 you should make me go out of my line 
 busy as usual but we should make it last forever, 
 it's not at all
