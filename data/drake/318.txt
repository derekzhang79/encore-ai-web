 i'm three up in discussion 
 building for 'em 
 cause my pop was in it 
 
 [verse 1: malice] 
 lights slow motion, steppin' out the house 
 'cause i swear i got the full package, a nigga complete, 
 i give it to you, honeybunches 
 you heard it all 
 
 [verse 2] 
 and i wish i - was still in school 
 so let you meet my friends so they can lecture me again 
 you a star, you only lose him 
 book yourself they need me to deliver 
 cos they hate it when the rookie star 
 they come few my condo 
 you can never will 
 i don't know 
 i'm here to star to the met gala 
 i want to play wit all day 
 'whats he worth?' fans keep trying on guessing 4 g's from last night 
 only wants a friendship causing me to her or better 
 i know what it is when i was on a mission haven't left for a story 
 i call off a couple of parking lot 
 but right now we got some action 
 everything
