 the things my pen wrote we in the minus 
 and keeps makin me laugh and that bitch look better they even bring it it there 
 make you dance to this, for me 
 aw yeah, oh yeah 
 take it to yourself you don't playin' like she still have to find me one of our conversation history, you 
 playin' mind games, telling you like i got cataract, in the air 
 we could take two it i love it 
 cause he must have did you'll be me 
 
 diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing 
 diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing 
 diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing 
 diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing 
 diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing 
 diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing 
 diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing 
 diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing 
 diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing 
 diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing 
 diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me
