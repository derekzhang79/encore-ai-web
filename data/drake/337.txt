 so i get a lot of girls be...thinking my songs like a stepping stone 
 goin' at a nigga throat like a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, and gnarly 
 i think i'mma call you over 
 and my word to 'em 
 back up, back up and wine it 
 wicked, wicked, wicked 
 back up, back up, back up and wine it 
 oh, yeah, she steady on grindin' 
 where, where, where 
 where, where, where, where 
 where, where, where, where 
 where, where, where, where 
 where, where, where, where 
 oh, yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
