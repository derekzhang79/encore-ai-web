 let them girls all that lipstick covers 
 if i got a life, back where i stay 
 
 girl i know you get impatient on you 
 i get her hot like wasabi 
 she don’t really want to hear us 
 remember? 
 motherfucker never loved us, remember? 
 motherfucker, remember? 
 motherfucker never loved us, remember? 
 motherfucker, remember? 
 motherfucker never loved us 
 i'm on a wave, i'm on a ride 
 season until the sun goes down 
 we gon' make this bitch if you need addressing 
 boss up, i'm the greatest my country's never seen ‘em 
 i’m all of the buildin' and got all the man already 
 try harder cuz 
 try try-try-try 
 
 [verse 2] 
 why they worth it 
 i mean, i buy the scene 
 i don't ever question you, i always stay for 1 more than just a mission 
 we would cross paths like an intersection 
 but ain't too much out on compliments 
 overdosed on confidence 
 caught up in superficial glammer 
 who dress like sara jessica 
 and i live for some dinner i'm make all
