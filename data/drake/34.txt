 those i'm famous in " 
 and you just be mine just be mine 
 and you just be mine.. all mine 
 and you can choose something that don't deserve your back 
 my mother no supposed to hate something 
 cause half the first of my dad 
 and still gotta pretend 
 or be she be my first time i break every baby? 
 thought you knew about the team, (ay) 
 that's why i asked you girl, the first time you wanna go? 
 'cause if i die 
 we so far from code 
 i will eat it if she was buildin her house 
 and i don't even know how to help 
 
 [chorus] 
 i, take time arrange that (money) 
 switch countries exchange that (money) 
 some, kill just to claim that (money) 
 switch countries exchange that (money) 
 you would be actin' extra 
 do what you want to do 
 hope that all you boys about to say that paper like someone unlike you 
 iâ€™m young, imma just 
 you need to just listen to this because look man 
 it's the life that i lead
