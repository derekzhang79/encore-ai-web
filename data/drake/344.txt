 live all the same shit 
 but fuck what they talkin' about me from the club to the letter 
 and kindly ignore my word 
 just love when it was that nigga memphis fuck and me wasn't summer and lay a card ya 
 wayne you got me on flights overseas, and i still text her to bring 
 hit the world with dozens of bags 
 feelin' like a hug i fall back 
 even though we both know it, we both know it 
 i know that we used to be friends, girl, and my dog is far from your girl 
 swerving out, panaramic 
 i'm hanging with a swag boy, all of a sudden 
 for the a-town 
 
 [verse] 
 uhh, set it like a soldier 
 she rode it like a soldier 
 i got a thing in my hand 
 a bunch of distant lovers 
 this a life, back where i hate sleeping alone 
 half the time we donâ€™t end up fucking, it's your greatest shit 
 you got a reputation and yet 
 and i try my hardest spot
