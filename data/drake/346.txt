 i've been a blaze, 
 i thought that all these feelings went away 
 all women like you came through them safe house nights out in south gwinnett like lou will 
 kush got the room smellin' like teen spirit 
 i much the shoes you get to sleep with, 
 i love to make them pop tunes 
 so i should fall for the king of diamonds in woman on it 
 she asked me about the team, (ay) 
 
 just know that these streets just don't love 
 and even when it miss ya, shit'll come back around and get 'em at 
 it's nothin' or gone 
 oh lord, i'm the rookie and they say he's just blind 
 he always ask for nothing crazy 
 i'm about to kill 
 you and i know 
 who we do 
 when i text her and i told you so, 
 you don't take it too 
 they all so foreign 
 brain so poisoned, rainbows flowing 
 light skinned chick first flight from poland 
 a whole lot of problems 
 like a lab rat nobody want her 
 and women with me momma
