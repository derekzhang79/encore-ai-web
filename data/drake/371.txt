 the chain too heavy to tuck it, i'm serious

 and i feel it taking more 
 about how i should act, 
 and following girls on the assumptions of what the worst city is 
 the fuck is up? 
 havin' lunch and ashamed

 just young and unlucky 
 i’m drinkin’, let's all get faded

 why am i really this verse made it 
 i got 'em hangin and the next morning you'll forget: 
 who, or why, and too much going things 
 but go ahead and pick a good girl 
 yeah, i can't have oh-oh, oh-oh 
 won't even been playin' with the one worse
