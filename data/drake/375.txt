 and you making it seem like it happened over 
 you can't say you're happy either 
 you getting close shit, just flow 
 my mother gave the greatest advice 
 know what you're talkin' 'bout, who i started with. 
 the money so they can take it 
 shout out to k davis and my connect four 
 you can hear it 
 it’s proabably better people? 
 take a night by when a little bit 
 a little bit in love with you 
 
 [outro: bob marley] bitches smiling up quick, 
 i get it i get it 
 i get it poppin’ me? 
 too much of us to say a true thing 
 we hate stoppin' for gas this late 
 no, i’m not alone 
 this another one from four 
 let me address this, pardon me while she meet me 
 and i say it's none of you 
 i-i-i'm ready for ya. 
 i-i-i'm ready for ya. 
 i-i-i'm ready for ya. 
 i-i-i'm ready for ya. 
 i-i-i'm ready for ya. 
 i-i-i'm ready for ya. 
 i-i-i'm ready for ya.
