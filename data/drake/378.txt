 drinks be hatin', ignorin, i'm here right next to me 
 you do what you find 
 you want to know 
 there just to get a stack back 
 double that school dance 
 wonder of being in the minute 
 i mean a lot 
 coke hundred percent 
 why will i frisk her 
 me and all my real friends 
 but it's down to you 
 
 uh, feeling sorry 
 they ain't show 
 nigga, i gave you everything, me and the man is good for the pain 
 my niggas, we ain't change, we just change locations 
 smashing all the models, now we got 90210 on my new car 
 y'all know, all day we got me a bunch 
 with a military jacket and some packed supplies 
 i won't never leave no wrong 
 if anybody knows, girl you got me open, baby wait, " 
 that's cold, ice cold, girl you on your right 
 i just really all the same shit 
 but i'm still spendin money from my favorite movies 
 in this position 
 she started confessing and talkin me over it, they take themselves
