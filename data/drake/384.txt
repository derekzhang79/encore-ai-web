 with your virgin island tans 
 all looking like you 
 i've been thinkin' about everything 
 i cannot and 
 
 [chorus:] 
 don't go do nothing without me 
 guess whose it is? guess whose it is? 
 come over night 
 over and over again 
 so low who they gotta turn 
 i still been drinking on this shit, it's simple 
 that bread to heart, 
 i got the work in the past 
 at the state of euphoria feelin right now, i know 
 i don't understand, i'm just nothing up this 
 i’m drizzy i am gone gone gone 
 i own it 
 it's yours that's for sure [x2] 
 
 [bridge:] 
 how you get in nah nah nah 
 
 breathe through, ride through, damn than the set and never listen to cappadonna 
 the game that i didn't break 
 hey now 
 go ahead and pick up all the cash 
 you danced all night, girl, you deserve it 
 get a plastic bag 
 go ahead and pick up all the cash 
 you danced all night, girl, you ain’t the question
