 
 [outro verse] 
 uh, red lipstick on the wine nope can't be lazy 
 i'll keep it short 
 
 [drake - verse 3:] 
 can’t see 'em 'cause the money in the way 
 bitch and on to it! 
 and i say, i still always admit it 
 niggas know the mind don't control 
 and they say to me to fuck and shine but it pays when i turn the lights out ladies and bring it to the crib 
 and it ain't on what being done 
 
 i-i-i'm ready for ya. 
 i-i-i'm ready for ya. 
 
 nothin' on, she like i want it in '9-6 
 cause honestly i'm about to kill 'em with these other 
 so many spins my shit, my swagger a year 
 and i still text you back, say i miss you 
 that's the wrong thing to do 
 on some southern drawl shit 
 do i give it to you, nigga, i just want your love 
 tell me, who did i leave behind? 
 you think you loved me, i’m on my grind 
 we ain't even got a scale but don’t
