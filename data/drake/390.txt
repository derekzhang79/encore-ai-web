 i think i'mma help it 
 you can die for it 
 just to put a million cash cream 
 we made it 
 i'm really going for the king of it 
 i hate sleeping alone, i hate sleeping alone 
 so i'll be over 
 
 [bridge: voyce] 
 i still got it for you, i still got it for you, i never been for dinner when you put it in 
 
 oh oh, trust issues 
 
 no you ain't explainin how you want it done 
 ohh, just wonder i'll take your marks 
 and i'm not supposed to find a brand new car 
 so me and my crew was all yours 
 i know when that hotline bling 
 that can only mean one thing 
 i really hate wasting your time to check when all you is 
 fuck what they talkin' about me 
 cause where we got some things that'll hit the culprit 
 them strep throat flows, them shits to stop for ya, 
 on that trip with me 
 no help, that's all me 
 even when it was lights out
