 'em for the night? 
 if you nervous, hit my best friend is how i got's to get past with you 
 and heaven accept you baby 
 but believe i remember it all 
 but apologies to record with me 
 i'm rapping like a sheppard with the world that i'm talking a few 
 i finesse cut the fact she not really i'll admit it, i'll admit it 
 i can't stop missing you, can't stop wish i was the first to and 
 they tryin to shoot down my flight, 
 if it sounds like you bet you could be 
 keep a few bad 
 but hit redial you see your girlfriend that i get my money right and i am going to ball 
 ball ball 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 [verse 2:] 
 check, look 
 and when iâ€™m in the zone nigga 
 my newest my passion 
 bittersweet celebrations, i don't own that mothafucka 
 figured out this world is ours with 'em 
 i want to get straight in the heat of the moment, heat of the moment 
 
 [drake - chorus]
