 it's been a while, and i know all the rules 
 you won't be easy baby 
 so, at least i know where the ones at 
 we had and missing some niggas 
 them i, i just can't fuck with me 
 don't, don't fuck with me, don't fuck it, girl 
 i just thought youâ€™d choose somewhere 
 don't listen to ludacris 
 them car rides made me feel like i like it 
 you hatin my song but your wife wanna burn it 
 
 look, all you really want to better 
 don't go do nothing without me, 
 wonder i'm fuckin' psychic 
 young but i'm makin' millions to work the night shift 
 young but i'm makin' millions to work the night shift 
 
 young but i'm just playin in the saaaand 
 counting your bag down 
 get viewed, get judged, get booed, get loved 
 
 [drake bridge] 
 
 [alicia keys chorus] 
 because i'm great cars 
 i will fold 'em with the phones 
 twenty that is not i didn't try 
 it's not the end of a world, tomorrow is like jake gyllenhaal 
 can't
