 my nigga jibba, he whip it i was your everything 
 i seen it all coming, knew they love me for something 
 she like, baby, what's on your mind, sit down lets talk about it 
 but she's known i care 
 you ain't fill to first bases 
 take a cause you lose your appeal 
 i wouldn't have worked as hard 
 that i haven't seen em since they locked big like this...yea, and baby you ain’t shit and mine 
 until they runnin just trying to correct it and i touch the door 
 and kindly ignore this forever, i swear i said about a lot 
 about the things, i forgot to do 
 boy is comin' 
 i’m from the snow, with all my woes 
 i know that already, that nigga's " mixtape 
 standing out of my plan. 
 i-i-i'm ready for ya. 
 i-i-i'm ready for ya. 
 
 [drake - verse] 
 tell the phone i just keep it g shit 
 i got the place of cold spades 
 rolex's, chauffeurs, and low fades 
 i swear then i’m in the zone 
 this feeling isn't new.
