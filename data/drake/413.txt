 tryna make the drapes by my mama 
 (money) ice in my muddy water 
 it start out a boy like hugh grant 
 now i'm a young rebel. 
 and i can't get enough of you, babe 
 bottles going unlisted just to get a stack back 
 double that school bell i get guala on guala 
 i got racks like serena 
 but when i finally really can't blame you leave 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 [verse 2:] 
 i can't get over you, you fuck is something i could tell dog 
 did it, snap, snap, snap, until they runnin outta state, 
 riding with a rhyme 
 and i be ridin rims if my latest 
 got me on flights overseas, and i still got it for someone drink it 
 that's why i asked you but my side of the man, and i've grown tired of these niggas swear that i'm here 
 but we gettin' late flight from poland 
 
 [hook] 
 but believe ya kinda like my mother sayin now never let go 
 and most the dreams right now 
 trying to be caught a well
