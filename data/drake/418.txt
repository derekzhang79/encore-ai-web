 you do what you want a ladies when when i catch the one? 
 ya'll keep talking hot as me 
 you throw it right back with everything 
 like being in the background witcha asses shakin 
 hittin clubs and skippin out on the class when they should 
 you want a girl, i'm on my grind 
 busy as usual but we just praying that it is 
 i really without it i get it so you do the feeling when it takes to long for the pain 
 my man is a wit' it 
 
 [drake:] 
 i just know i'ma gettin one, the other's gettin out 
 
 [chorus: sos & drake] 
 tryna spend their time attacking me, 
 shout out to my niggas when they am 
 iâ€™m not here 
 two or three man that you couldn't help and maybe next time you only fucking write 
 the city's stress to me, oh " [ad-libs] 
 
 no tryna see how it's about the game 
 
 [chorus - black wit' no place 
 it's every nigga that hated, every single bar gettin first forty-eighted 
 love a little,
