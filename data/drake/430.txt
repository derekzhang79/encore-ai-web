 mu mind is clouded, this shit complex here 
 we would cross paths like an intersection 
 but mama still praying for the higher power 
 because the house might did the numbers i swear i always fall for your type (ohhohh) 
 for your type. 
 tell me they a home, i thought that i broke 
 if you tryna bring up on you, own that shit 
 heard it's worth it 
 and so i can come, 
 there's times i couldn't fight too too much of that shit raw 
 and with a couple of breathers 
 and then the reasons and you trying to call me lobster 
 cuz i aint always attacking them niggas 
 the to wake up for exactly what i earn bruh 
 this time of people are practice 
 and maybe you don't belong 
 all the way home 
 and you do what you want when you heard things 
 damn, yeah, i should all my homies hit you right now 
 is a motherfucking legend 
 it's too late for my city i'd be gone till november, then november
