 look, 
 i ain't talking about some real money 
 you don't never one ever put your ass too fat 
 capitalize that, and i'm at the music that i won’t regret 
 i’ve been drinking so long 
 i get it i get it 
 i told you i'm spittin it from this 40 million dollar scheme. 
 just know better all that i like 
 ain't ashamed to admit it, i'll admit it 
 time for a lifestyle, lifestyle 
 
 [verse 2] 
 i wish i was in my teens 
 yes lord, i'm a star, sheriff badge, 
 time to lay up 
 you doing me dirty 
 i'll bring some friends that old plug murked 
 ain't no other woman that should come for me
