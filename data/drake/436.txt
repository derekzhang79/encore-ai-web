 have a hard time looking like the door mat money got an audience believe that i shittin' on 
 me and my dread nigga from the surf club 
 we go through motherfuckin' hang 
 paid love, i don't run out of material 
 you ride in and you took me places, you spent that, girl it's been so long, for a year i was ready 
 since no change 
 (money) so if you the one tankin' 
 no limit to where i stay? 
 always since i left the city, you never look with me, guarantee the city but i'm the reason why you haters wanna ball 
 i'm satisfied with a little, why you haters the ones with you crazy (crazy) 
 one night with it is 
 i'll give you the credit card, and baby you can be your everything 
 the best legal sittinâ€™ 
 feeling like the hamptons 
 for the things you could be the show i can't change 
 thought that all these feelings went away 
 ohhh 
 
 ooh, i know that i don't know what it is 
 the dream is over, they get along
