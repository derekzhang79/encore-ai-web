 iâ€™ve been avoiding commitment 
 but she been like when you see me a piece of a dam 
 i really hate wasting your business 
 if i need me, oh oh oh oh oh oh " 
 i don't feel the same 
 anywhere i go 
 i can't help but know 
 i don't know 
 like i don't know 
 pilled up filled up damn 
 we even gave your nickname to the crib 
 i know you told em' shit is purely for sport, i ain't always missing her at a dinner table 
 she asked me 
 what am i afraid of? 
 used to work, used to dance in texas 
 now she never mentioned it like a great night, i just can't explain this sh-t at all fall 
 but that's what they thinkin they, they hear up on they sister 
 magazine paper girl 
 but let it go " 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 [verse 2: waka flocka flame] 
 round of applause, baby check it out 
 so i guess i got to the point and won't hide it 
 niggas done being silent 
 don't
