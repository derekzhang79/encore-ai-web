 smoking like you changed up, i'm with it, i'm all in someone i've been out walking 
 i don't do too much scheming 
 y'all ain't a new lust for this shit 
 oh yeah, and did you agree, it's a must, 
 let's call the whole thing off 
 we used to had enough of us 
 let's call the whole thing off 
 we want it all 
 it look like we in love, but only on camera 
 just be mine just be mine 
 and you too fine to be laying down in bed alone [x3]

 and establishing up that old man and that he can't do this on her tongue, 
 i can't be accepted 
 and so i ain't thinking drake get smart girl 
 oh yeah, oh yeah 
 oh yes, oh yeah 
 i wake up and have you feelin' late
