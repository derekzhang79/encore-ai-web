 cause my young niggas 
 seems like to get ready for you that be super conscious 
 just wait 'til i get my money right and i am no willy advice 
 all your faded on the map 
 [?] pass my phone 
 motherfuckers drunk and tired 
 tired, she steady on grindin' 
 where, where, where 
 where, where, where, where 
 something that you know the truth, this a be the man no one like we almost too embarrassed to ask 
 you just so long 
 i might nothing what it would change, 
 now i’m high 
 just a girl that just spend their times and i used to have hood big nigga, 
 fuck them other guys 
 i ain't bluffin', cop jewels in the fall 
 but uh, still take the time to chance i was hurt that year 
 kenny's caravan and tell me what you want 
 i'm what you need, what you need 
 he's what you want, he's what you changed from the jump 
 just always love her
