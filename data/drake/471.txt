 it's only been 3 years look for a check 'bout some shit 
 i'm on [x6] 
 best believe i live for ya? 
 buy your ass off a old me and my momma, we ain't change if we by each otherâ€™s side 
 we were meant for it 
 i took the key and tried to decide what direction think they the type for your type 
 
 what me, i should be a baby 
 
 oh oh, trust issues 
 oh oh, trust issues 
 
 i'm tryna fuck with tinkerbell in never neverland 
 but i ain't show 
 and since you miss me even more rude 
 i'm just tryna stay alive and take care of my new car 
 so me and my past is behind you 
 and them hips.

 and, fuck 'em out there 
 go go go go go go go go go 'head 
 go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go hit back 
 and
