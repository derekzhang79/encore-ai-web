 
 [future:] 
 you doing me dirty 
 you doing me dirty 
 a shot to give inside 
 every single time i used to say you stay 
 niggas with a heavy case load 
 when i'm feelin' the door for me 
 and after next never get it's right 
 let me address this, pardon me before 
 
 please don't read anymore, we could have, we could take it 
 this nigga still in the club doin the same ol' two step 
 while omegas doin the fucking gutter bitch 
 i ain't talking nothin' but big money bitch 
 
 i hate the shit you do 
 i take these time for niggas like to do too much on my last adventure 
 past the present when it touch to this song... and it goes out 
 we haven't talked in a while the choir sang his chorus 
 and uhhh, 
 the boy songz is the replacement 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 [verse 2: kyoko] 
 baby just because i never thought this would end 
 i make you beg cause you ain't talking to you not
