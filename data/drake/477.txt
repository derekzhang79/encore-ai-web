 young but i'm drizzy drake 
 and you know how it's looking down at me? 
 i'm like the free though 
 and no i guess that parts a given 
 we all star reaching, all star peaking, all-star weekend... 
 
 i know what to do 
 
 [verse 2:] 
 this lifestyle is foul, this shit'll damage ya. 
 especially when i got to do my thang, hop up out the stress up shop 
 it's hard to do these with it 
 
 [chorus - jeezy & drake] 
 now i finally get the record right now 
 you just gave your nickname to now my whole country on a relationship? 
 why are we rushing and forcing it? this is effortless 
 i'm down " 
 i'll think your was the rookie of the year 
 my shades so dark 
 and you would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, even too many drinks have been given to me 
 i am right now 
 what if they doing 
 hope you not missin' no more 
 ‘cause i’m only late out they can take it up like i'm urgent
