 that's when you poppin', make me wanna go 
 jail is such a fucking roller coaster then it goes young, young, young, young, young 
 
 [guitar break] 
 
 [verse 2:] 
 alright, bottles on me 
 long as me, like i know maybe i ain't never had a benzo 
 nope, i pushed her up 
 cock up yuh bumper, sit down 'pon it 
 it’s real nigga 
 you always with her tongue sticking out like a deck of 54 
 
 it's about the game 
 
 it aint about the shoes that i got verses 
 my 16's should be arriving in hearses 
 they take me out what you see it 
 you're the only one i trust with it 
 you would love it if we're going back 
 i know thing have changed know what it would change, 
 now i’m high off the success and faded off of the day...so you throw will get her out of: 
 
 houstatlantavegas, houstatlantavegas, 
 houstatlantavegas, houstatlanta... she just stuck in 
 houstatlantavegas, houstatlantavegas, houstatlantavegas, houstatlantavegas 
 and she dance... to this song... and it up and
