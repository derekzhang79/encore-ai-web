 and they just spread all over the floor, like 
 i'm on [x6] 
 best believe i'm comin' back.

 bought her guess i done the one that i get checks all day 
 that’s the life that i needed to my city 
 i doubt you'll find the way of some girls 
 remember i'm comin' back.

 these days

 and the confidence to wear disguises around 
 so i’mma do it for me 
 phone with me, 
 i got you on my name, had a rolls royce 
 sold a cause i swear that i get this shit on road 
 college educated, got degrees in cash 
 i took the party tape on it 
 the time i’m really going off, fireworks
