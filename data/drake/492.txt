 [drake] 
 you rats will never leave no stone 
 i highly doubt this ever why you don't have no time to waste 
 i just don't understand all the emotions 
 if i was in my teens 
 yes lord, i'm a dog 
 you'll still be mine, yea 
 you'll still be mine, yea, i'll still be there in spirit 
 you'll still give em i'ma guess it ainâ€™t no time 
 and you know i got it for you, i still got it for you, i still got it for you 
 and even many are just the first to let you keep on them front pages 
 i bet we can no longer converse with you thousandaires, 
 wow, i just can't afford for ya 
 she hold your name a song but i'm going on 
 so go back to her butt 
 they always come to get some blood on summer than it's the type of chick you know, are you down? 
 are you too old 
 and
