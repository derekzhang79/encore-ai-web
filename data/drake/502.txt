 probably why i had the time to write this song. 
 texted me the other night, it's been too many years for you niggas 
 feel a baby 
 i feed my family with this 
 everything is all right 
 and we just like the holy father 
 you gettin' bodied by a time bomb 
 
 every thing that i play with you 
 just a new lust for 
 this one is for real
