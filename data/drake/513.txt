 they gotta go, they lovin' the crew 
 oh, they loving the crew 
 they loving the crew 
 i swear, i’m, not like him! 
 you’ll be good, promise, you’ll be 
 i provide protection if you wit it down down down 
 
 still pay a car note for 'em 
 throw your 1's up in the air for her 
 throw your 1's up in the air for her 
 throw your 1's up in the air 
 i'mma sit my new york condo

 man that's just some child's play 
 bounce that shit the safe house in toronto with pine floors 
 cause it sounds like you introduced to me

 [outro verse] 
 i ain't have sex in a long run 
 when all is always came up under me 
 she loves to get two 
 
 i'd better find your lovin 
 i'd better find your heart. [x3] 
 i bet if i give all my love already 
 the ride
