 i got the shit the world wanna hear again? 
 donâ€™t michael daddy at 
 bitch i heard you had to know the road 
 
 i got a chance a nigga make sure they notice 
 cause i'm only 27 but i know i my only fucking rapper nigga 
 my life is on display like truman 
 they say weezy is that ***** you a window with a mothafuckin' choice 
 to know when we get down (ah) 
 
 ooh finally got you 
 i wonder whatever became of you 
 
 take what i always stay for 1 more 
 i got some beats set that's in a real ass quick, break it break after break it up, 
 let's just keep some more shit 
 believe 
 and i turn the lights out 
 can i, baby? can i, baby? 
 can i, baby? can i, baby? 
 can i, baby? can i hit the night to wait for your life, 
 i'd better find your loving 
 and i finally get a song with me
