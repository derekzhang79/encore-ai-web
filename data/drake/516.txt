 [hook] 
 why? cause it’s all playing their role, put that on it 
 i'm on [x6] 
 you gon' think we printing money cause i'm from the snow, with all my woes 
 i know that's when they trying to get ahead 
 i see all of them bitches gonna tear us apart. [x2] 
 
 [drake] 
 today it begins 
 i don't know 
 watch the whole dance get turned over 
 
 next time 
 wine it, wine it, very tennessee 
 come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight 
 rounds tonight with his ass 
 so let me be super conscious 
 just wait 'til i get it, 
 and i feel like oh word, true " 
 
 [drake:] 
 and i'm the man of the day 
 i just wanna be, 
 
 i feel the distance 
 yeah, i said i’m on one 
 yeah, i dream big, no false hope 
 my name drake and i’ma get her though 
 i count this money up, i'm already rich 
 i do the chores, 
 the cars you don't listen to you 
 i've decided the case
