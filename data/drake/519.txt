 you should be when it heals wrong, that was last month 
 and when you little nervous 
 and you have your girl face 
 plus a phone then a couple of cold spades 
 rolex's, chauffeurs, and low fades 
 i swear we at war and iâ€™m very patient 
 six squad on the cover up you niggas excited 
 i don't really have a choice 
 can you make me know i want it all and then no hesitation so i'm shooting if i draw for it, 
 so why don't i have an honest moment wit' you right now, baby? 
 tell your friends that don't understand 
 i'm legally obligated if i am in 
 houstatlantavegas, houstatlantavegas, houstatlantavegas, houstatlantavegas 
 and she dance... to the memories of love 
 be for me, i'm going - amen 
 we need some really nice things 
 better be fucking amazing, 
 the more, they washed up 
 go ahead and turn the lights out ladies and gentleman 
 double d up hoes, dolly parton 
 
 [drake:]

 not even from my new spot 
 and im in the city they
