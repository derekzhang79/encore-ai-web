 and the way that it's just words and they them all see the one? 
 whatâ€™s in i guess i get talking to myself but i'm a couple steps behind 
 that's why i'm asking calling if even to them 
 
 [chorus:] 
 i, take time arrange that watch got girls is for twelve hours out like a hug there's somebody new girl 
 
 [bridge: bitches keep low, i swear i ain't about to prolong, 
 imma keep my faith in the dark clouds 
 
 [k-os] 
 more way, nigga you not text them my nigga going crazy 
 already on my door and told him that bitch that ass up 
 call you buy here and kill out of my pie 
 and still gonna change with me, don't fuck with me 
 don't, don't fuck with me, ain't yours 
 i keep tissue paper 
 still in a box of concerns 
 ain't more than just an option 
 hey hey hey 
 refuse to be forgotten 
 hey hey hey 
 with a kiss heat of the world bout it 
 let's call the whole thing off 
 we used to had enough
