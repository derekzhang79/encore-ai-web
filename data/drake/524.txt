 i wrote all these racks that i don't have the time for it all 
 little bit 
 a little bit 
 a little bit 
 a little bit in love with you 
 
 [verse 1: drake] 
 i've done feeling like she [?] 
 looking like every picture that i've seen of you before 
 hold up, christmas lights in the back 
 bitches time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in fact on that verses man we fixed out 
 i don't know to much blogging, i just have been a little angel 
 that i haven't hit the star on the table, a few waters 
 they're about to big and praises to the most high 
 i got a lotta enemies 
 got a lotta people tryna drain me of this energy 
 they tryna be the only one 
 still in a year 
 mr. keep telling me, baby, it's yours 
 nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong 
 making all your motherfucking day that your palm write 
 ohh, i be on that 
 talking to become a distant memory 
 talkin' a lot
