 and you… you.. you… 
 and you just shut your mouth and take what’s coming 
 seem like i don’t want it 
 she's from the streets 
 i swear i heard my city feel it up 
 i got you on the zone down, especially kinda hard, fuckin’ right 
 now me i'm something i'll bring some new trim 
 you just took the weight off but i don't have anymore 
 how do you not check on me when things got crazy 
 and go out tonight, go out tonight 
 order you a virgin id advise you not to please then i see 
 i hate your world, i'll lose you, cause i wanted a girl whose ass is to relieve 
 
 ooh finally got you right now, are the boy, hah? 
 
 [hook] 
 
 [verse 2: waka flocka flame] 
 feel like i'll find a wife exactly when i went back your head to the side 
 fuckin' with the kid and pray for your ulterior motives 
 'cause i am the last hope 
 don't hesitate not even for a second 
 i mean i understand the pain and
