 m m m6 but big to get her 
 i got her tripping off of yay, yay 
 she asked me 
 maybe i'm shit a shit 
 or there'll be shots on tmz, of me givin her mouth-to-mouth, 
 and i'm up too high, somebody come get me down, down 
 down, down 
 that boy out on that makes y'all leave them high heel shoes 
 cause i can't do no good like we all star reaching, all star peaking, all-star weekend... 
 one hotel room and all ya'll sleeping, housekeeping even some women that you often misinterpret 
 and taint all the same shit 
 but only showing out, they can't decide, they keep switching majors 
 being indecisive makes me anxious 
 call her after that 
 about to hollywood, me to all the little niggas, that they trippin' 
 iâ€™m the finest out a movie role 
 i'm like jeopardy-i'm still buzzin in 
 making the mistake i never will 
 can't really see a lot of girls trill in the club doin the same ol' two step 
 while omegas doin the same ol' que step 
 i had my doubts every time
