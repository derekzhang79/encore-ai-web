 (uh) 
 that's a diamond on her tongue, 
 i can't feel you on you like it 
 take you to see like i miss him after as a reminder to myself 
 i will never know 
 why you don't need that girl, she did it all wrong 
 if i ever lose the connection 
 'cause i donâ€™t put it on your wife 
 if i give her space,ah 
 dealing with the world with dozens of bags 
 feelin' like a couple about 
 i bought this one a purse, i bought that shit just a car alarm 
 yeah, alexander mcqueen, 
 i'm just stop our relationship like my boys are - it's our ends 
 and live on a roll 
 and that thing that i won't 
 like what you say, what you 'bout for you to fuck and i try and get high 
 i start, 
 
 [verse 2 - drake:] 
 how up your time how the shit you say a lot for you that 
 
 feel a way 
 i've stopped listening to things you say
