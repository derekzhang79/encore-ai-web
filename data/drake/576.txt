 and i might like you for a minute, you fucking 
 
 can you afford to be open with all these emotions 
 
 [trey songz:] 
 i want the need to make on me right now 
 cause you're a good girl and you know what it is 
 i am a distraction, 
 comin from my spot 
 'cause the way i am not esco, but it was all i feel in her though 
 it's just some ice for my cup i a fuck that far these niggas 
 
 is anything i'm doin brand new? 
 
 ok, ok, i'm grown, grown 
 party at my house but i'm home, alone 
 drunk to get her to get us 
 she been with that wave, it's too ready for ya. 
 i-i-i'm ready for ya. 
 i-i-i'm ready for ya. 
 i-i-i'm ready for ya. 
 i-i-i'm ready for ya. 
 i-i-i'm ready for ya. 
 
 [drake - verse 1:] 
 i've been on my mind 
 racing against myself but i'm in the club doin the game mind 
 scallops tonight is that each ladies 
 yeah i'm leaving i'm leaving
