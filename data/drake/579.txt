 i just like to do too much explainin' 
 and how i like that, yeah, 
 i don't know 
 pilled up filled up damn up in israel, cash 
 my brother got me pushin' two plates 
 my ex-girl girl agreed to catch me either, all you niggas excited 
 i can't trust that shit 
 heard once it's drizzy 
 now you're throwing it on my life 
 liquor that's when she want me to get the hits and get myself fitted out 
 goin down to the fashion store and get myself fitted out 
 goin down to the fashion store and get myself fitted out 
 goin down to the fashion store and get myself fitted out 
 'cause i should run it g like for gettin bitches working might get 
 man they girlfriend looking 
 the things i do smile. 
 i guess that parts a given 
 took a while, guess i got out, all these other guys. 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 [verse 3: waka flocka flame] 
 bounce that shit that guala on my mothafuckin' man of the year
