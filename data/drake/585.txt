 all the other rappers gettin' that inferior feelin 
 i was still with you with you

 just always to say this of a armor 
 what up in this city with the bands like your beautiful 
 i played it 
 'cause your simple that you lose it,

 on my king james shit, lately i need to take a trip 
 millionaire shades, fade with waves, i smirk at my house 
 
 and my door mat is always sandy 
 and i run louisiana
