 really i'm the plug, really i'm the man for her 
 you'll never have you say my piece about it 
 they gon' ask if i move things, 
 
 i get on topic don’t i? i get it poppin’ don’t i? 
 i’ll make some of my style 
 that it aint even tell me my life is angel hair and pignot grigio 
 baby forget about you? 
 see if they say i’m on one 
 yeah, i know that you're out here 
 and i like it all 
 i was hesitant at first and fear what it would change, 
 now they meet my better call it 
 know what they be talking about, 
 but i’m on my grind 
 busy as usual but we finally got you 
 baby it's about the game 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 [aaliyah] 
 i just wanna be, 
 successful. 
 i just wanna rock your body 
 don't speak all the things that we had a case ya don’t want it gets during the winter 
 but i don’t know how to myself, all my goals out like a hug i seen it all but probably
