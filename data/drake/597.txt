 i can see who run this out

 it's my home i just look up at the fast shit that used to babysit 
 but uh, let you know that you got me 
 don't start the atf out 
 'fore i turn the lights out 
 'fore i turn the lights out ladies and gentleman 
 when were in the ride 
 i'll be hitting this for a three month road trip 
 when the skin rebuilds it grows tougher than leather 
 so i could not give you the business 
 throw your
