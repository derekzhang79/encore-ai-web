 these days i seem to think a lot is never ever thought 
 i ain't talking nothin' but big money shit 
 i get guala on guala 
 i wave a song for me 
 i'm still a canine at heart, i'm a dog 
 did 
 it's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for me 
 stunt like we drink i live my wings and life that i lead from am to pm

 it's hard to do these things alone looking 
 everything we can pay it 
 and to top a while and i swear i call em sesame... berkstown 
 'specially when they say that you're over over your life
