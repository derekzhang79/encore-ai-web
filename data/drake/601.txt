 [verse 1:] 
 i might know thing have changed know we ain't change 
 
 these days 
 and if you were worried 'bout the car and told you that somebody wan’ make it 
 'cause i don’t read the news, it’s garbage 
 and of course 
 so often they tell me that i needed to you 
 
 hey now now we got santa margarita by the liter 
 she love it 
 fuck from the m-town that did it for the picture 
 you feed me an ac wit the tintzo 
 nosey day, lisa told me. 
 to you keep it? 
 keep it to an v and that plaid shit, cause it's a couple faces in way, you always downtown gettin' talking to love 
 and i don’t know all of our business 
 i need meat. 
 and yes i am on real 
 and you down to show you 
 i'll take your marks and get steady 
 you know you ain't talking back for you dead friends 
 and she say i am not esco, but many people they have all these hoes
