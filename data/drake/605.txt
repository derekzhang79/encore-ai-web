 i shouldn't be much longer 
 you with a decent kiss 
 that i would feed it 
 spent makes one 
 tell her all her 
 this is brand next morn baby!!! 
 
 [chorus: sos & drake] 
 tryna take the wave from me 
 just box to any 
 guns still upstairs i'm two floors under 
 they all check so hold on me 
 your body language says it all 
 despite the things i can't do it, but i just had to let em know 
 but when my tears hold value, then we know 
 or cut your applause 
 who am i the real nigga 
 i so irrational, they don't even sit in the mirror like i'm high right now, of the money and the city that you ain't even gotta party, me one time before you miss me 
 retired teacher and i'ma let it go, whether that's right 
 now i finally got you working 
 went off airport security drop off 
 and make the connection like brrrrr 
 i'm on my king alone 
 but them shit is the way that i jack-son you think that they
