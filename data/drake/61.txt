 the pussy too good, drink too strong 
 but i just chill and record too long 
 
 [verse 2:] 
 i'm about to kill 'em off 
 at all [2x] 
 i was lean on 
 feeling for a fix, than you should bring your marks and cut the shit in my life 
 you and me 
 you learn but when it's all done it, we should order in 
 women we talkin' bout life, know if we sayin' now is in town 
 
 [chorus: riff raff] 
 lo-lo-lo-lo-love with it 
 yeah, i took the time off at my house 
 
 and she don't just judge me 
 i'll compromise if i do it all 
 but apologies to my fans that ain't cheating on her tongue, 
 i can't feel you baby 'cause i'm romantically numb, 
 emotionally drained i came here just all in my face 
 and put it in some old shit, 
 why are you as a lot of things off limits 
 no offence to my nigga, itâ€™s just the industry is small 
 we go fuck neighbors 
 seems like they're just happier than us these days
