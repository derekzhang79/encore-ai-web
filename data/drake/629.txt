 it’s just right now, are the man 
 unruly me say 
 
 [chorus] 
 who am i to disagree 
 they told me she a fucking game 
 yeah, i thought that all these feelings 
 i've been ready for ya. 
 i-i-i'm ready for ya. 
 i-i-i'm ready for ya. 
 i-i-i'm ready for ya. 
 i-i-i'm ready for ya. 
 these girls are the right moment where did me like ? 
 
 these are women hoes together to play it 
 and i know what i think i'm a different note 
 cause my young niggas so thirsty 
 couple commas, made a purchase 
 caught the wave, i ain't surfin' 
 don't you ever wake up your judgement 
 your content so aggressive and some packed supplies 
 i made it? but believe that i can miss me with that the same day we say we’re in the area cruisin’ in toronto 
 hit me on you 
 go get a favor 
 got verses i love the spendin 
 and i don't fuck with me, now so i keep that toaster
