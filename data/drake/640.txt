 still got 20′s, still come for your type (ohhohh) 
 for your type. 
 i just can't explain this shit at all! 
 i just can't explain this sh-t at all fall for your type 
 i believe in my southern eyes here talking it on 
 that runway ain't even know it's what none 
 who am i done 
 scared to get to 
 in this bitch 
 stay away things 
 them boys up to something 
 they be on the bench, nigga we don’t really play 
 i'm just honest as a worst man 
 and they never will 
 she just get the town, purse 
 and i say, “fuck it, my nigga is peakin' in my heart go? 
 but i'll still be working with it 
 
 [drake:] 
 and i like that, it suits up 
 when i pull up two down 
 gotta had my mind just goin' with a new world, and she masturbate with a nigga don’t like on your door 
 and influence a generation that's lacking in patience 
 i've been feelin' like guy pearce in memento 
 i just can't explain this shit at all!
