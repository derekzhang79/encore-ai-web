 you won't lose 'em when i go you'll still be mine, yea 
 you'll still be mine 
 and you just be mine just be your everything 
 you won't ever have to watch 
 don't fuck with you 
 i don't really understand it 
 
 never has the chance, if i want you to know how it would 
 draft day, a. wiggins 
 i put it on you--crazy

 i hear you talkin', don't know who you from around the side

 they can't decide, they rollin' with unprotected

 you niggaz i'll expect you 
 i got to be unstoppable [2x]
