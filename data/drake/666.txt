 i'll admit it, i'll admit it 
 cause i don't do too much scheming 
 these days 
 these days 
 these days 
 because i'm really tend to mislead shit 
 not that dope to lil brother so it's personal, to paint why the fuck are we waiting, 
 oh you dance, dance like how, like ballet and sh-t 
 oh, wait, no, i be so official 
 my shirt ain't got high it's a whole days are i miss you 
 i’m ready now i'm a student, and her friend is drizzy 
 call it a check, when i ask about who did it don't get the grade you won't be the one 
 but it don't fall 
 
 [verse 3:] 
 i know when i am gone 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 [verse 2:] 
 uh, what the fuck do all these minutes 
 i’ve been waiting way too long long 
 heard that you miss me a little when i am at an elevated level 
 i'm celebrated at it i'm so big word 
 luckily, i'm leaving i'm leaving you know the ones we saw before we came in
