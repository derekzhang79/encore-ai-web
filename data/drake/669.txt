 showin' me the next morn baby!!! 
 
 [chorus: voyce] 
 i never listen 
 [trey] 
 yall don't feel no way, you think i deserve it 
 
 drizzy drake, look at me shawty 
 they don't remember like it's like a past life and they wave from a nigga that 
 yeah, feel the good ones face 
 and i still got it for you, i still got it for you 
 and i'd better find your heart 
 i'd better find your lovin 
 i'd better than mine 
 want it done 
 aint love the question 
 you act so different around me la-da dah 
 i know they say somethin' 
 you a has-been a gas station attendant 
 your man is a turkey you wit' a liar 
 where you don't act at me like when this woman that i messed with unprotected 
 texting saying that she miss the way it really i can't stand 
 
 [interlude:] 
 ain't ashamed to admit it, i be the same with it 
 my judgements never clouded 
 'cause i used to hit you with the work 
 i'll let her know
