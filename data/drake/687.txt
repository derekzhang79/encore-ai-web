 i am a a-li-en, a couple of 'em 
 with times when i might be too strung out on compliments 
 overdosed on confidence 
 started from a white bitches, now is back on these niggas that ain't no glaucoma 
 i'm never on your mind?

 what i am in crazy competition with the past 
 this why no bad bitches too 
 usually we understand theres his foot for my wife

 i’m just back on my streets 
 if i try to put some lotion all over your new york condo 
 why you don't really understand your right 
 maybe i should know how to stay 
 but you don’t mean a guarantee 
 i mean, i ain't myself
