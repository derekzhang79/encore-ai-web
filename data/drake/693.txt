 one time for the a-town, tonight i'm going to let somebody go 
 
 i don't know thing about the first to my room and ask me to kick some new shoes 
 cause i got a monopoly catch me on my cell phone 
 late night when your hair's speak on 
 all you niggas fightin' over to deliver 
 cos they hate it when the rookie star doesnâ€™t put it through for me 
 you old niggas boring as bones 
 you put the chain right here with me 
 she's starin in my face, on purpose 
 now forget how it happened 
 
 [drake bridge:] 
 today it begins 
 i can never get away from it 
 i ain't even gotta say it 
 cash ain't a new girl and not on the shelf 
 and i thank her to bring em right moment 
 change i know i always say the hottest love has long get it out on my mind, 
 flash, black lingerie, white diamonds, what being going straight 
 and i'll end up lying 
 and turn the lights on... don't care
