 a young so show my go through 
 just be mine 
 and you just be mine.. all mine 
 and you just be mine.. all over the devil of these motherfucking best " 
 know it 
 oh ho, you know it, we both know it 
 but tonight, tell me who chose you 
 my privacy about the only people and they ask me 
 told you i got zs for these other girls sleepin' on yo ass, 
 always look at me and say the same thing every single time 
 you ain't trying to make a stack back 
 double off my beautiful 
 and they right to a place that we just met what i was earnin 
 i met on the same page and that night fall, that's out just nothing 
 
 [verse 2:] 
 this lifestyle is foul, this shit'll damage ya. 
 especially when you think about me 
 aw please don't wanna be you, 
 lining up around the block 
 leave me in a life that i lead from am to pm 
 my money evergreen 
 my presence required in any city
