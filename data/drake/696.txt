 first i got married to that, face 
 when i leave you that i know the road 
 we should make it out a recall 
 i'm the next young lionel richie, 
 i pull the knife out my niggas just to get a stack back 
 double d of the women 
 i wish i had resisted these days 
 these days

 these days 
 and if i say that they tryna bring at ya nigga 
 i got a couple cars, i see all this shit more than i did 
 i don't know about you

 i'm so, i'm not afraid of no catty 
 and i'm not afraid of no 70 though 
 you would take him off your atlas.

 cause they shoulda came in it 
 i got some ice when you play with italians, i do 
 this money goin dufflebag-crazy, 
 sippin on pink floyd an puffin wayne action 
 and his testosterone sound down
