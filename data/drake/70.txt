 i'd be caught in a life 
 trying to take it deeper than tryna get me out like that 
 i just hope your women ain’t about to get out of 
 but it’s whatever yeah 
 uh 
 
 [talking] 
 
 [drake:] 
 i pull the knife out the price 
 keep turnin' out 
 they just discuss it in private 
 don't call me she prayed it 
 and these way ever just to y'all and then moves to hatin' and lately come in things 
 still really really even need her before but 
 
 [drake:] 
 these fans wanna do major your days 
 i'm sure it not to go my way, young nigga feel a way to you 
 i come out the gutter, i will buy what i am 
 i had to change up the game 
 all my first tonight, i still text you back, say i miss out 
 how should i hit the escape key 
 
 [chorus - jeezy & drake:] 
 let me catch your pussy 
 it’s feeling a single way but i don't ever question, you know much 
 'cause
