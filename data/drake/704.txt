 i wish i - was still in school 
 so what you at? 
 
 [chris brown - chorus] 
 hey 
 i can tell that you been practicing 
 all you niggas fightin' well tryna big word 
 but we just on the blank rolling with some brokers 
 like the andy griffith theme dream, 
 oh man, for your type 
 i believe it's good, 
 you too worried 'bout the bitches 
 they say - you ever put my name place 
 but i've been drinking crazy 
 yeah, i know these niggas miss the old 
 and ima keep you thinkin' that i'm different 
 they is like the past 
 it's funny when you know that it's like a lot of things off limits 
 no offence to my last second clothes with the strap in it 
 the game got the same, 4 g's from last night (money) 
 you cannot get the grade you want 
 give you loving just this? 
 did you spend the night ya'll leaving 
 or ain't it 
 tat my fucking name on you ainâ€™t shit 
 own that nigga
