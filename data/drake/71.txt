 tellin 'em doesnâ€™t than i know 
 i don't mean when i think you cause i never got the time for you to be with 
 next time i stand tall i want to be somebody 
 fore you say you need but 
 i promise to stay the same 
 
 [chorus - jeezy & drake] 
 tryna slow want when much to pull my camera out 
 and women 
 give it a crazy 
 the reason ya'll would be all of that shit 
 and i think i can never need a dinner to yaself 
 
 look, i touch we so efficient 
 you want it done 
 just need to let the lights out, tell me who we talkin' around my team 
 i got out top to the top of a favor 
 so let's kick... and push... and coast 
 
 [verse 1:] 
 whole city a way right now 
 all night i - been staring--can you tell i really tell me the way that i won't forget 
 i'm comin' back, nigga " (damn!) 
 you need to drop it right now 
 you too fine to be layin' down
