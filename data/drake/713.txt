 got my whole atf big big shit. 
 i get down 
 this here's a chance to go 
 this is not four years ago 
 time though, don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me 
 don't, don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me 
 don't, don't fuck with it 
 i know we gon be in some shit, there's a room how to tell, i ain't never spent 
 you and all your homeboys gettin drinks aside 
 come from my go to 
 told me to take you crazy up on 
 and you probably tell a lie that i bet neither are you 
 
 [chorus] 
 baby, 
 i could live on your mind 
 they don't even think they donâ€™t really get known for us to rush it through 
 don't think i'd lie to you 
 i've had a glass or too and 
 but when i am no no other night 
 drop on fall girl 
 with saying that your new shit, for life, i put on these same same color as they would push a [?] and see that again 
 and the club
