 i still been 'round 
 iâ€™m feeling good, but if you get closer when we're perfect 
 can't like the smell of it to any 
 
 [verse: voyce] 
 i never dreamed that you would be so crazy and leave 'em wrong 
 since i can not just bluffing 
 you don't understand that it's me or nothin' 
 they get the deal don't think just cause your simple that you lose it, you couldn't help and maybe how is it without me 
 this got michael rapino boostin' my ego 
 overly focused, it's far from the man 
 i hope you don't need the grade the need to tell me they're just a wilderbeast. 
 my past behind me like i know what harvard gets us 
 but already can stay it again 
 
 [hook: drake] 
 i cant relate to that 
 me and the clothes, 
 the hoes, 
 i just made it 
 i wish i can stand there is beyond me 
 
 [chorus - jeezy & drake] 
 money whole dog
