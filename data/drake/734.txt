 women wanna say we stand, i could get it back 
 we're covered in lies, and that's okay 
 my summer is just rosé and calamari 
 look now you at the love of the work

 niggas wouldn't help them not get the money out of something 
 like my new scene 
 take my crown to the grave, i'm an underground king 
 but the blue beach 
 cartier wings nigga two seats, nigga gettin money like a cashier, so hand your receipt if you wave, but i can't fuckin stand you 
 say, “baby, i love you” 
 if you ain’t running game i'm too willing to play that fronting 
 i can't trust no fuckin' body 
 own that shit, own that shit 
 own that shit 
 own that shit, girl 
 money make me feel good but please don't move on 
 
 stance on lean, leg up on the wall 
 yeah i swear that this ones different put it on 
 double cup love
