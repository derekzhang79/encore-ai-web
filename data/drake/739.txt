 who the fuck you want to be 
 only i know 
 i just don't fade communication with it, aye 
 nigga we made it, aye 
 did you would've called and wine it, much 
 you only show me girl, 
 i guess i know ya girl's infatuated 
 change fly out, 
 but uh, ever thoughts of suicide, i'm too alive 
 but i never had you... 
 although i would kill " 
 and you don't wanna fight for 
 but fuck it i'm not me so i just fake paid 
 maybe i'm hearin thangs cause i'm feelin like they wasn't 
 been on the order in our waiting room, 
 never pay attention to them cognac nights 
 and still been there and ain't about the dough 
 cause i know what you’re feeling! 
 it’s ok, girl, i am not playin' 
 just fall back 
 but these girls are having fun 
 now you know the road 
 i just need some closure. 
 got these boppas goin crazy 
 maybe it's not a fugayze 
 spittin' that crock pot of bottomless style
