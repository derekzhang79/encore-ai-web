 you deserve it 
 
 yeah but still never bring yo breasts along 
 instead that drop it to niggas the lesson 
 feel like they wanted me dead but baby, this shit is everything i'm doing to late? 
 that's the motion (ooh) 
 i guess that's just the motion (ooh) 
 i guess that's just the motion (ooh) 
 i guess that's just the motion (oooh) [x2] 
 
 you used to call 
 you when i turn the lights out ladies and gentleman 
 i'm going in [x4]

 that's if you spill bars like a second chance and to her bag 
 come and get me
