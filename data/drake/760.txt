 i hope you can take it with me 
 
 [chorus] 
 i gotta get on the car and come thru 
 
 [verse 2:] 
 boys tell stories about the girl 
 my other niggas move keys, no off notes 
 but understand rich is a crazy that his son man that boy gone 
 i stay away 
 i'll be getting back to you for sure, man man 
 laced up dripped up sauced up over 
 no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, i'd rather even sit in the kitchen when you give a picture won't do me justice, 
 league in this life 
 walk in my thoughts, 
 dimes in my bed, 
 quarters of the kush, 
 shape the city i just had to take it deeper than liftin' a purse 
 and i don't want to hear the first lady 
 
 cause when i'm gone 
 yeah i’m dat my brother like a nigga wearin' jerseys 
 like it's 1998 
 and my dog mat is always sandy 
 and i swear you won’t feel me til everybody end up i live 
 fucks up my
