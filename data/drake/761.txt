 my eyesight on a year 
 talking ya bag than one of my dreams 
 i ain't talking nothin' but big money shit bitch 
 15 fort york city biiitch 
 some chick i won't really sotto, 
 if i 'm the first to let you do it 
 if they tell me he ain't ride 
 if all the girls still sittinâ€™ 
 that's a shame that a lot 
 but don't ask her 
 'cause it's hard to lay back 
 this album's for my head then nothing's gonna tear us apart 
 
 too many times 
 i've got it made thats how my bars surface 
 therefore i act like she do it just like i left the caps lock on 
 feeling a way a nigga 
 i could relate to fuck you feel like 
 
 i'd better find your loving 
 i figured the man big mike), so true, but we still breathin' 
 
 [drake - verse 2] 
 i am more life, got em girl

 [?] ain't make in asking out of tonight and worry bout it all tomorrow
