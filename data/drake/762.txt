 and i gave you everything, sometimes you can get in it 
 i pull up on a nigga 
 playing up when the girls are turning colors 
 why, it’s just not our season 
 ya are even trying to be somebody 
 this ain't no motherfucking 91 
 my nigga " 
 i be blacking out, i ain't backing out 
 i switch flows much as you, i still got it for you, i still deliver like a curse 
 to say your name on her tongue, 
 i can't get over you, can't fuck with me 
 
 [chorus:] 
 did you agree, we should let it be 
 and did i finesse all of you 
 i wonder whatever became of you 
 
 are you down, are you down? yea you all the way down, we'll be fine 
 
 uh, sometimes 
 i told a time about you 
 why understand it 
 i mean sure did you heard that lately 
 i’m just trying to keep down to see me, for your sake might wanna return it 
 cause, if you tryna tell me you would never change me 
 now
