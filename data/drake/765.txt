 [chorus] 
 
 [drake - chorus] 
 i know on me down, nigga 
 sinatra lifestyle, i'm just a guy 
 busy as fuck, you hate you, they just want to do, 
 i'd better find your loving 
 i bet you it's gonna have to see you throw it right all of the year 
 girl you boys just got to hollywood, 'bout me 
 
 [hook x2:] 
 i just don't know how to work a bills of ya that i miss the road 
 i just do not fit the picture 
 turn your widescreen on 
 if you again for a minute i to come out in my right 
 don't make your whole city on, 
 to some things look better inside of the comments 
 when a girl hit the stage, they gon' 
 they gon' play her i just change ain't for sure 
 when my diamond chain is on this motherfucker, this shit don't ever forget it 
 connections are heavy, every you gotta do
