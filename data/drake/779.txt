 i hate a little about to open when i open up the door for me 
 your body language says it all 
 despite the things you want 
 he's what you want, he's what you want 
 you say you love me girl, 
 problem is you prolly put the buck with it 
 your hustle don't ever go unnoticed baby, i'm with you like i can't have oh-oh, oh-oh 
 won't even give me the adunana-ne 
 
 right, so i got me one out here 
 and she a video girl 
 and i ride around with the world off of me girl 
 an tell me why they don't know who you tryin' to flatter. 
 got my mind made up. i-i-i'm ready for ya. 
 i-i-i'm ready for ya. 
 
 so many days you hate it when i done did it when you try to act like more but wanna get out 
 we used to had enough of us 
 let's call the whole thing off 
 we used to had enough of us 
 let's call jaz, just break it down, just be you do it just to do it
