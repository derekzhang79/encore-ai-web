 guess i swear i’m on one 
 fuck it i'm not here to love

 i've been doing this before, at your emotions 
 if you i'm wit it 
 
 [drake:] 
 worst behavior 
 
 [verse 1] 
 i live for today, plan for tomorrow 
 had to get it popping with you 
 and ooh soft your loves desire 
 soft your love 
 you get the crown 
 but the good ones go 
 the good ones go, but 
 it’s goin' gold 
 we'll have to leave my real friends wanna burn me 
 she know it’s out on the glass 
 i just bit 
 no new niggas, nigga we don’t take a couple shots for a suitcase 
 i bet if i give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart 
 
 too many times 
 i've never been 
 i can lying but 
 i bet you it's it like that, own it

 round three "
