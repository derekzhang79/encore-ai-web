 i just take a couple of breathers 
 and then long as you got me 
 when i need a beat, i need the producer. who gonna be so long 
 i know you say i was comin' to the top 
 don't go do nothing without me 
 can’t keep all the time for you 
 i hope that you are never quite about it 
 hate when we stop at the intercontinental 
 and anything i said, feel 
 raw dog, her answer, 
 that'll die to bed 
 shit… wine or water 
 nigga we threw a lesson 
 seen a million, breath, you're looking 
 i'll be here just swanging 
 don't make me go out of my section 
 don't hit the road 
 i just gotta see for myself. 
 
 [outro:] 
 i gotta' keep watchin' for opper's cause' anything's possible, nah road 
 and i still got me a promise 
 don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me 
 don't, don't fuck with it 
 she asked me 
 your money, so come and skate with me 
 bring it on, zip it up.
