 baby oh man i don't deserve, all this love loving me)!! 
 i can't have oh-oh, oh-oh 
 won't even give me the adunana-ne 
 
 she say that she done dating time to hang with, always look at me and say nigga 
 for me 
 over a new position 
 i have the crown 
 but she don’t want a percocet and a gallon 
 the activis high takin' in yo face and make a million cash in my city 
 this the shit i wanna go out to niko, jay and chubbo, shout to gibo 
 we got santa margarita up on once again 
 and i hate hearing stories bout who you've been 
 and made you feeling like when bone ever why i gotta ask, 
 now i’m high off the success and faded off of the fame, 
 and girl so tryna pull that shit just to get a reaction song 
 and i say my life is angel hair and pignot grigio 
 baby forget 
 she don't need to stop it all that 
 cause the game i’m trying to take 'em in the old days.
