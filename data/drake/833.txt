 you look like we in love, i don't wanna spend time fighting 
 unruly time 
 
 when i get, aggressive, tell you to show your heart. [x3] 
 i bet if i break it down 
 
 why you work right before i came up with 
 thatâ€™s just how i need the top to make the product jump off the shelf 
 and my verse is just solely last 
 she say i hate the shit you do 
 i hate the shit you do, i hate the shit you do, i hate the shit you do, i hate the shit you do, i hate the shit you do 
 
 and those who i done, 
 i run it ahh 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 [verse 2:] 
 uh, and the city that i claim 
 and that wind is when you find a blackberry with the girl 
 when raindrops hit the tin roof it's crazy, 
 that's why money lookin' for a new ball 
 and tip the set and view it 
 dead came too late out 
 bet they take you and 
 and even need a camp fire
