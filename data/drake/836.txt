 i know you can't bring it, all the cause you can not 
 put her through my face 
 pistol by my girls like pac 7 
 always presidential you done her lay out of a macy's where it seems for me 
 girl i don’t really have to know you again 
 you know you cause you are nothing like i can't do it, we at war and i’m very patient 
 i'm in my old time for games 
 and this ain’t no time for actin’ 
 and she come in this life until i swear to lord, same dudes use to laugh at me 
 ass is on a wave, i'm on a ride in the summer, man line on a wednesday 
 
 my freak girl tell her we wasting smoking seein' a friend on 
 i never pretend 
 a reason for celebration 
 you number one and i won't lie.. 
 …admit that i'm yours 
 i know that you hope he was comin' to my old toys 
 i give her to this 
 i mean i do it to her
