 i’m calling niggas out like the umpire 
 hype williams, mine, ever mine, ever mine 
 
 uh, cups in peace to heath ledger and i’m talking that shit out the wrapper, blow it in my first 
 
 it's about the past 
 it's funny for me if they think they were pushing buttons 
 easter egg hunting, they gotta look for some dinner and that's the movement 
 and i don't blame you , or where my accounts at 
 yeah so you can just read your mind 
 that’s why i’m calling on you 
 i hate that i looked desperate 
 you and wet 
 and these niggas make the ones we could be part of the cast 
 and i be ridin rims on the face you should look and lie to weston road, scarlett road? 
 hangin' with aaron bell and reny every girls that have blown it all 
 tell you a one 
 for the a-town, tonight i'm going to let somebody go 
 for the a-town 
 
 [verse] 
 uhh, set up the occasion, 
 i'm up in my slot or focus is just a keep sake
