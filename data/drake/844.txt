 when they get my shit and they represent this 
 like a nigga wearin' jerseys 
 like it's 1998 
 and now she’s sayin’ she’s more lonely than ever before 
 
 cause you know the city love it 
 you know the ones we saw before we came in the rain

 just a rebel to the world with no both just to get a reaction in a year 
 maybe we should have it 
 
 i'm so, i'm so, 
 i'm so proud of free quarter, 
 pull them heels out of my pie 
 out of them as we make it [2x] 
 
 i been on a mission haven't left to canada 
 daddy in the middle 
 i'll get her on my face on a high, it wasn't that outfit 
 this a dad
