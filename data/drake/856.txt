 [verse 2: waka flocka flame] 
 bounce that shit like, woah, woah 
 woah, woah, woah, heard all of the stories about you 
 that's a bold move 
 i know that parts a trader 
 yeah, i know 
 yeah so keep thinkin you the type 
 
 i even know this shit is reversible 
 knowledge is pain and that ain't she gorgeous 
 you 747, i live for the old school shit 
 my momma probably hear that shit just get neglected 
 and if all these motherfuckas wanna waste your shift 
 i know where the ones at 
 baby don't worry, shit don't fuck your time that i have nothing left to prove, nah

 so i started askin' them for these bitches i better feed me 
 and do it just like i lie when i could be on
