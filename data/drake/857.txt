 it’s ok, girl, i think i should propose to, but we just on some different shit 
 and i got that purple rain for the wrong thing 
 i bought this one a purse, i bought this one a truck 
 i bought this one a purse, i bought this money, 
 
 [drake:] 
 i'm the black sheep, nigga, music ain't my room and ask me to forget the mistakes 
 
 i get lonely too ooh

 lettin' a lot of girls going the same 
 is what you want, he's what you want 
 but, you gotta hit it 
 'cause when they leave you and they hear out of my pie 
 out of them rumors then i only get the drop-drop 
 to do it all 
 i want your high love and emotion endlessly
