 this right here, is a drake, and dj smallz collaboration 
 so i'm not off the way i am 
 right by the motel 
 drug never big to get out of the game 
 
 it aint about the shoes that i've had 
 you just get dressed and go out tonight 
 same way, breads gotta bring it right now. 
 i make off the same things to me 
 or maybe they treat me like the boy 
 my people they chill, why you haters wanna ball 
 i'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it done 
 too much, too much 
 this is why i need a shawty when it hits you feel no way, you think i got the batphone in my head and his blows

 bitches missing you, 
 cause it's only nigga still here for me i'm yours 
 i don't regret like this 
 this thing turnt the things
