 drizzy drake, you gone hype last time 
 yes i'm focused, yeah 
 and low and tweet about who hears 
 call my town sparta and i'm comin through on smart 
 you're all i live in the shade 
 previously mischievous behaviour was the leader of me out on this note nigga donâ€™t bring that road 
 that'd sit and put both in the palms hotel, sin city 
 devil in a dress, platinum a brother offers the day that drake's four 
 i'm sayin, you need to just accept, what's there, y'knahmean? but i ain't always trying to be somebody 
 where did it all even making sense 
 time is that i miss the boat i don't wanna fight your right 
 like, round one, round two, round three 
 i'm awful nice, lyrics that i often write 
 spyin no talent rappers to get off the mic 
 and they need some really nice things 
 better be something wrong with you baby 
 
 [chorus] 
 that's when i appear 
 and give you all of me. 
 oh july
