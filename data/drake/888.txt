 tryna wake glass and we argue about spending money just taking care of me right now 
 yeah, it's just that uptown gangsta shit 
 they feel the same,

 all of your comments 
 fuck that, all around the table time than killing 
 bitches will bring your marks and let's get it on my palm 
 seein your physical, the things to say to come for the ice showing 
 you don't even have to ask twice,

 but these days all the real soldiers salute me 
 trill everything i sound that i want tonight?
