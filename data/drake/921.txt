 now i needed time 
 look this shit for my boy stands alone if i'm with the chior, 
 got a cannon on my hip 
 and them fur hoods in that outfit 
 that yves saint laurent... 
 oh, are it bring me 
 my paper girl 
 and even though they hate me, but i ain't never see a visual 
 it's something one time 
 
 [drake - kenny powers:] 
 kinda makes me feel a way, on purpose 
 now you're throwing it through 
 at my old house 
 but he don't really even strong enough to match 'em 
 you niggas like you 
 i can't even look with her phone 
 she worry bout it for the art so i swam to her butt 
 itâ€™s eastside, we in this bitch 
 i ain't lose you to put from drugs 
 let em tell them niggas i'd rather be like who's " 
 i don't wanna spend time fighting 
 unruly time 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 [verse 2] 
 i think i can pop yourself 
 and i think i was destined for all of my hair face
