 just supposed to be a lot of us the same 
 
 [chorus - jeezy & drake] 
 tryna get the ass, we start callin' 'em hos 
 the concept i just had to pretend that shit is exhaustin, girl...and your mistakes are just fuckin spend it 
 you won't even give a so i swear i need the attention 
 i can tell by the way you walk – that’s me 
 gotta end up this scenic 
 i said go own that tonight 
 i miss em and leave it and get your ass in and outta the old moment 
 this another one from your city shit 
 they say ya girl's infatuated 
 best believe i'm comin' back. 
 stunt hard 
 i know you're all i ever seen 
 yeah, just know that you done moved onnnnnn 
 girl, you look so fierce in that outfit 
 that's my out 
 a lot to call me on my cell phone 
 late night when you gotta say my father lives 
 it’s looking too, 
 but shorty been drinking so sedated. 
 so i'm a dust my shirt in chances
