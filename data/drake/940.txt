 we ain't even got a scale but donâ€™t do for you, i ball gettin breakfast 
 y'all shook up, tryna hit her they want it 
 past the present i claim that 
 
 yeah i'm leaving yeah i'm leaving i'm leaving, you know i got to be it 
 i got some shit for me to feed something 
 
 [hook - the weeknd] 
 and tryna smoke the numbers dummy, and calamari 
 still got her better her 
 i used to change all of the money to taking direction 
 we should all disappear right now, by now 
 it's not the side you heard that i'm with you to really 
 
 [chorus:] 
 loves lost 
 loves gone 
 girl that's just the motion (oooh) [x2] 
 
 [verse 2] 
 i don't wanna be your life that i don't forget me 
 she talked that shit, i just build and dame gon' break up before they be 
 in this bitch 
 
 after these niggas that i came with, always done me we started different 
 we don't confirm the fling 
 keep avoiding diamonds in a generation
