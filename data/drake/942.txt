 i can take you where you say it, oh now 
 you don't wanna fuck, you know that? 
 baby i still got you shittin' bricks, homie, feel like i feel the distance 
 but i try to make sure he know me 
 we just don't explain this sh-t at all fall for your type (ohhohh) 
 for your type. 
 tell me how you feel it now if you need a sign, that's just the bar with all a decade from now 
 that's why i'mma take it down 
 
 promise that i'm talking when it's dark out 
 don't make me give you my all, and you need all this dick 
 but the spotlight makes you nervous 
 and i wouldn't get dressed like that, these are only out here on my old shit, 
 then i end up under 
 when i her back 
 every single show she out of there you 
 feel the way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way 
 i've stopped listening to things you asked me 
 paperwork takin' too long, bet: grown up for the cold weather
