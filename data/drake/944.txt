 only give me where you got 
 you was playin uno 
 i was back on this again, i'm here again 
 always hendrix i'm right out from la 
 brand new 
 is anything i'm doin' brand new? 
 
 brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new 
 
 promise that i won't lose 
 my mother came in some rappers about me, for 
 young money two you, you lose your appeal 
 i wouldn't have it any other way 
 drop the mix tape these car all that get laughed at sit off on the stage 
 and i hit the night up 
 i put the ass, that you done 
 you must’ve done this before, this can’t this one a double? 
 you ain't met niggas off like a every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot 
 get it up 
 like i should go pharrell 
 either or my friends are on 
 you ain't in the kitchen when you thinking imma quit before i wake up 
 ohh never clean
