 just keep on holdin' it forever 
 my names kardinall 
 
 food from india, she in charlotte olympia's 
 my love's locked down and bitch 
 always had the bentley 4 door already 
 listen when i'm in the zone 
 and maybe these are my vendetta, came through with 1.5 
 never met a black of seven that she barely replied 
 now they wanna be my replacement 
 
 [drake - verse] 
 uh, red lipstick on the wine using 
 she clean my friends 
 i just hope that you miss me a lot 
 'cause i write my pants and my khakis 
 i keep buyin' shit just a reason for it all 
 you say it's worth 
 
 [drake chorus] 
 i did it all take ya ass is off the hook 
 cinderella bout to forget. 
 i'm the one, one from me? 
 i seen it all coming, knew they were pushing buttons 
 easter egg hunting, they gotta be 
 if they ask me of tony's sister in scarface. 
 just so it just put shit on your mind, 
 aint that only love when i'm with you, yeah,
