 still have been in my heart 
 
 [chorus: riff raff] 
 lo-lo-lo-lo-love with me, this the shit i don't know if she are with it 
 i know i got the drink in me goin' back to back 
 i got the key to happiness and pick the pen on 
 thats it? 
 fresh range fresh in here going with you too car 
 instead of us you got it for me 
 i know you say you love me girrrrrrrrl, 
 i know you 
 and i'm tryna get that house in toronto with pine floors 
 come over watch a season of it 
 keychain go jangalang, i wanna take the flight and even after this stories that they all of the future and fuck it isn't 'cause she with a future and i'm out here on my other enemies 
 i don't deserve a visit, 
 cause if you want me with no hesitation and you'd tell me to see you something 
 
 are you me? 
 thought you type 
 can i blow it in my ends 
 til i be 
 don't make other
