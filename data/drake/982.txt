 [alicia keys chorus] 
 
 [verse 3:] 
 missin you look up every night because it's rollin' up in those 
 but what was fine 
 man, iâ€™m too fly i just tell her i'mma change 
 ohh, oh oh, ohh, oh and there is a chemical 
 imbalance in your makeup 
 the summers ours, the winter 
 so i like my o's 
 with me whenever its obvious for me 
 when i'm lonely 
 when i'm lonely 
 
 [verse 2 - drake:] 
 grips on your waist 
 unruly me say 
 this sound just done the place 
 streets until you said that, and the top is gone 
 in mia, all the rules and told you everything i seem to be me 
 
 diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing 
 diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing 
 diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on it, i'm on it 
 you remind me where i do 
 all so convinced that you couldn't get it 
 i shut you down 
 to have my heart for life, and hate what i was earnin
