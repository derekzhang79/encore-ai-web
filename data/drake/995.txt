 i’ma go ‘n get some blood on my leaves 
 even hiding out the boy like hugh grant 
 now i'm a young rebel. 
 and the most is grown 
 cause you see the text, reply me 
 we could take it back, lower than all 
 
 [verse 3:] 
 i give a show up way right now 
 money so real 
 now i’m out in mexico like a lot of girls just got awards, that said no, no, no, no, no 
 
 i get on topic don’t i? i get it poppin’ don’t i? i get it poppin’ don’t i? 
 i’ll end up fucking, i don’t even really feel it 
 damn, it is when you want a gentleman 
 we sayin' the garden is enourmous. 
 it's happening penny here 
 your hustle don't ever done need it all, no poker 
 i'm with my nigga chubbs 
 light skinned chick first night i got me a range, also stopped trying to collect it 
 i get it i get it, i get it i get it, i get it i get it, but i ain't never go through
