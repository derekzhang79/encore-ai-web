 her love is a thousand miles away 
 her love is a thousand pictures 
 we're in the park then i started to cry 
 as we knelt on the kitchen floor 
 i said mommy imma love you till you " 
 but i'mma have the last laugh in the end if you know i look better in my blood i was born to be alive, the day of days 
 yeezy in the house and we got on in gold 
 number one years later she driving like we won the sweepstakes, what! 
 we headin' to the roc in here 
 trying to make you feel like one of those old r. kelly joints, ya pearls 
 so niggas still gettin' popped on the day to day 
 we made it in america 
 
 [verse 2: jay-z] 
 i pledge allegiance to all my niggas, impregnate bridget 
 soon as this flow end, i'ma let mos handed 
 and who you had " 
 back to the gap that's sensei, nigga 
 told you i'm a game boy 
 they like oh shit 
 i believe in my sleep, i'm my grown
