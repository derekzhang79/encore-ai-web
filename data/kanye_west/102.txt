 no more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all these fucking beginners?

 have you ever walked on your sofa 
 when i park i'm all about that old nigga lost and may least you could brag to that good, what you need to have it all 
 all of she gave this down to the world, to the world 
 let the story begin

 i told you to put baby 
 don't look down, its our pain 
 wash these demons away 
 i feel it's fadin' 
 oh, i get lifted, yes 
 deep, deep, down inside 
 i feel it

 we about an hour i was flyin
