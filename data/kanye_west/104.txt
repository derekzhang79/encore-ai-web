 tryna see me 
 and i can't wait to go to sleep. 
 last night i saw you in my dreams, now i can't wait to go to sleep. 
 last night i saw you in my freak dreams 
 bad decisions, drop the album 
 and now i look and look around and there's no loans for sittin your ass to sleep 
 i don't need to own... 
 
 [kanye west:] 
 just want to feel a new state of mind 
 
 [chorus] 
 when you decide to break the rules 
 cos i just heard some real bad news 
 real bad news 
 
 oh you just gonna 
 keep it like somebody stinks. 
 
 [chorus] 
 and i can go 
 
 [kanye west - verse 2] 
 question.. 
 what you need 
 i got them cars 
 still be known of sierra leone 
 and i'm tired of lying 
 my ladies say, good music 
 but my sight 
 is better tonight 
 
 sun in the club everybody screaming out 
 
 i'll be there in five minutes, five hours later 
 i'll be
