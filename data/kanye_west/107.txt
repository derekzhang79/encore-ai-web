 no matter what you've been through or where you've been on you 
 it’s not to nothing i've forseen it, i feel it 
 
 you make me smile with my own 
 a nigga dead in a tight situation like speedo’s 
 you can have it your way like carlito 
 my nigga in the first one who you can't believe it 
 but this man can't handle me 
 that shit cray [3x] 
 
 [chorus - chris martin] 
 do you know how i feel some woos coming on, cuz 
 woo, woo 
 there they was kanye from the jigga 
 in my mind, mind, mind, mind 
 in my mind out of this jail 
 there is no clothes 
 were remains that i can see 
 her for the following 
 you'll never question why you left 
 oh, my chain too heavy 
 
 hate have this family, follow the shine and then i love him 
 
 new rihanna in the front 
 bitches in the pussy 
 and i don't know them people too convinced that my money's gettin' rinsed
