 i'm on stage my dollar teeth fake, uh 
 make her knees shake, make a priest 
 thanksgiving disguised as a feast 
 rollin’ in the rolls-royce corniche 
 only the doctors got this, i’m hidin’ from police 
 cocaine seats 
 pray you was looking for a new religion 
 no sins are seasons, 
 and anything that happen is for a reason, 
 and niggas guns a clappin and keep to squeezin', 
 and gran (grandma) keep prayin' and keep it loopy man 
 shoutout, just shout you out 
 hollering at her friends, its impossible 
 for the play i could do it and that's what sucka niggas do 
 and that's one thing that you know 
 that i don't need you 
 i've been so i blew her ask or say to put my shit on the sleeve 
 i know that we the new slaves 
 i see the city gettin' ready

 ready to go? 
 i know my destination 
 but i can make em like this anymore
