 i swear i wish somebody would tell me 
 ooh, that's all i want 
 i want it for my crib like a full house 
 cuz whenever i “shh-shh” 
 success never smelled so sweet, i stink of success 
 the new jersey. i won't add up the pad and pencil and jotted what i feel right 
 i'm tired of puttin 1-8-7 in my niggas to get you

 after that, give you something 
 i'd be clear and lets be fair 
 i guess i get what i deserve, don't i?
