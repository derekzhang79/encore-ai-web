 so i’ll never take that bitch in the city 
 dropped bread on the news 
 channel crew presence 
 speed boat swerve homie, watch out 
 plan full of coke rental car from avis 
 my mamma used to say only jesus can save us 
 gotta call 2pac over, yeezy's all on satan 
 how you gon' hear the loudest screams, comin' from inside the screen 
 you see how the scenery rock yo? 
 
 [hook] 
 
 [verse 2:] 
 i wanna be on 106 and park pushing a benz 
 or live your peers 
 now walk with me 
 
 we back back 30 hours 
 
 [kanye west - verse 1] 
 may the god’s be with me 
 y'all niggas can't control me 
 i know it g 
 i appreciate them motherfuckers gone 
 i've been on this flight like a g fight i came by 
 just to blow up? 
 get it in chi now 
 you know that like i'm hugo's boss 
 why i keep calling you in my dreams, now i can't wait to go to sleep. 
 we found out, we found out
