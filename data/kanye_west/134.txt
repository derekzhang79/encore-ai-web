 advice to all in the same bitch about the presentation 
 thats how you be with this red and really need em up 
 you all you high me 
 even if we fuck right 
 your neck, i looked up to the dust 
 get your bitch got home 
 didnâ€™t i spoil you? me or the money, what you loyal as a beat right, hey 
 oh the real nigga quotes 
 real nigga back in the house again 
 black timbs all on your couch again 
 black dick all in here, hey 
 playing 
 please drop the blunt and disrespect the king 
 you got to thank yeezy. 
 and when i grew up she showed his number in my mind 
 of her to the bleau she tried to sip the fountain 
 the smokescreens, perceptions of false reality 
 who makes you get that shit 
 i'm just not myself 
 make you stronger, my brotha 
 and getta mournin' the end of the world, of the day who i'm sober it's over and you ain't got nothin' else to do 
 don't take me: i mean to hold it down
