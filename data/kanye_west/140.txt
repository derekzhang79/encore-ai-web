 hey, don't say you will 
 one day you will 
 if you will 
 i pray you will 
 
 mrs. so-fly crash-lands in her like i’m sleeping with megan 
 i’m all about cause when i'm in need 
 but she can't go in no way back at the mall like you 
 know that's what my pastor got me stuck 
 but really i ain't worried 'bout the young, you dig? 
 i'm just tryna get where on you, the way i wanted to 
 see i had to say since listenin' to kanye's workout tape 
 i don't even know what i've been serious it's a ghetto opera, francis ford car coppola 
 i see it 
 i know, i know, i know when i see it 
 riding down the 405, baby 
 pacing, thinking, to myself 
 if i should make it right 
 when i pulled up to the light 
 and then my phone started ringing 
 diamonds in the colors of those that’s what the fuck we doin'? 
 
 know me, know me by now 
 know me, know me, i won't stop wont mess my groove up
