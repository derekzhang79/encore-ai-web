 feels like we bought it all 
 the mistletoe's right here the whole card has been thoroughly piqued 
 and america is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey 
 the youngsters who were programmed 
 to continue fucking up woke up one motherfucker 
 
 back when the doctor told me i had a um.. i was an asshole, 
 i said if i want it, i should go pro 
 we only god in what we just re-united 
 lets make a nigga gotta hurt 
 
 [chorus: pusha t] 
 yeah, didn't let it be the projects now them no vacation kanye to one song gotta best believe it 
 the roc of love and let it be 
 i mean nothing with christmas 
 i feel it 
 been bullshittin but i finally arrived with it 
 i wouldn't piss on your ass like wesley 
 swear i'm shinin' bright, like flashing... 
 lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, spot
