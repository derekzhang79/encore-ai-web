 i hate the music 
 basquiats, warhols serving as my muses 
 my white bitch on first class

 eat your salad, no dessert

 try and put my candle on you

 i got weed, drink, and a handicam 
 all of these drunk and hot girls 
 a power muh'fucker a but, i ainâ€™t the way 
 but don't ever wonder 
 cause i know a nigga like me aint living two tickets get all you outsiders 
 had cyphers with yeezy before his mouth wired 
 before they call lawyers 
 before you tried to destroy us 
 not short boss 
 got a fresh on me 
 come in all them diamonds 
 though it's thousands of miles away
