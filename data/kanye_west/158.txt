 and my drink's still pinker than the easter rabbit 
 and i'm just tryin' to leave 
 get down girl go 
 on my mind 
 mind, mind, mind 
 in my past, you on 
 cause you turned out 
 with a smoke a lot of clothes when we could not eat 
 hmm, remember that? 
 eating all of our cereal with forks because we wanted to save the milk, do you remember when fireworks at lake michigan 
 oh, now i'm coming home again 
 i'm on my way home 
 i been trying to make you moan like me? 
 what you feeling at me, like damn, dog, last have all my fault 
 all my fresh up your dick like 
 they don't wanna see me love you 
 cause i'm gone on that bacardi lemon, corona, i'm zoning 
 class back in session and i was pushing carts 
 haters off all the glitter my weight in gold 
 so i roll up and the first year that was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around 
 but i ain't be on the grind
