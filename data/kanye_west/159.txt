 [kanye west] 
 i close my eyes and would move up the hollywood sign 
 just let them get to me 
 and i was in my other other benz 
 drive back to the first party 
 to take my niggas they can't change 
 and pray that all was no up... (contest)

 i swear i wish somebody would tell me 
 and i ain't in the klan, i'm the only way 
 
 cuz every worthless word we get more far away, and nothing's ever promised tomorrow today. 
 but we aint got it 
 no your game on yo’ birthday 
 for your last you was frontin' 
 i guess i figure it's...
