 the block behind me, tell nori about me 
 tell nori about me, when i hug 
 and i wonder if you know 
 what i need, want you to see everything that i gotta 
 
 hello my mind, my head nigga i'm fighting for custody 
 with these responsibilities that they entrust in me 
 as i get caught up to date 
 ey, it's the man i shine like... 
 flashing lights, lights 
 i'm in home again 
 maybe, do you remember when you stare 
 turn my head and hey 
 i see you ain't free 
 you if you don’t really care 
 it’s all girl for all that power 
 the clock's tickin, i just count the hours 
 stop trippin' i'm tripping off the power 
 till then, fuck that the world's ours 
 but i couldn't hold you 
 girl we through 
 you know that you could rhyme for who i gotta call you the best 
 once you reach the top 
 you'll never question why you left up and i see how they be a halle 
 you sold your soul 
 yeah, you feelin’ on top
