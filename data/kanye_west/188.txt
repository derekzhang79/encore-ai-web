 and if we both honest 
 who lasts? yeah, you lie 
 spent the whole summer 
 tryna be by my bars 
 now every time i hear bout other nigga's stroking you make real kids cray, nigga 
 and more shit than the models 
 the good story of a low riders 
 tell me what you see in me 
 you wanna kill the vibe on 
 i'm the night 
 no more wastin' time, you need to do things even in your wildest 
 this the christ year, last point hard 
 this is a god dream 
 this is everything 
 this is everything 
 everything thing, have all on 
 that i had sex with you clown niggas 
 i'm up with my niggas 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 [outro] 
 oh ho 
 oh ho 
 
 [verse 2] 
 man, kids don't like it 
 they deal it right 
 i'm gonna rap down, where a nigga just went ham 
 
 hard way, i got new 
 fuck around the world 
 and a bag of weed; the roc 
 
 [hook] 
 
 [verse 4: ocean]
