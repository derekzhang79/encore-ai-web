 don't call you all fronting 
 everybody feel a ride 
 you just gonna say good night 
 if we die in each other's arms we still get laid 
 
 [chorus:] 
 she gives me money 
 now i see it 
 i ain't no way i'm giving up. i'm in stupid until the pain or the hangover? 
 fresh air, rolling down the window 
 we got no clothes got no clothes 
 ain't got no hos 
 we broke, broke, broke, broke, broke phi broke 
 we ain't got it 
 got no money got no money 
 we got no money 
 we got no clothes 
 ain't got no clothes 
 ain't got no cars got no fucking phone 
 this is the first year that i blow 
 so next inside i still ainâ€™t amazing 
 maybe it's time for lift off 
 you said, what'd you choose me " 
 but don't anybody. 
 she wants me to get a hoe 
 yeah, i'mma have the laugh in the end 
 cause i'm lost in the world, been down for my whole life, 
 i'm gon' give my chain
