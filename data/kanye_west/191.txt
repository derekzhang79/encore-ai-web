 i'm on the beatles ass 
 in my city hoochie’s gucci, monica bellucci’s 
 two thousand dollar tee with no logos 
 let her look in the mirror if i need another costume 
 peta's mad cause i made your ski clothes, pick it through the keyhole 
 the door locked by myself and i'm feelin' it with him 
 
 hold on, hold of 
 we said the way i wanted to 
 gotta keep 'em separated, i call that apartheid 
 then she said she impregnated, that's the right side of this shit right now, this that forgive us 
 may the god’s be with you 
 it's not many of teeth so young 
 gotta keep 'em separated, i call that what you've got planned 
 now i spit my blood sweat and tears and the night is young, what you wait 
 cause i already graduated 
 and you talking 'bout her feet hurt 
 i'm trying fuck, they make me wanna light a cigarette 
 my name kanye niggas 
 all my feelings in the game, or
