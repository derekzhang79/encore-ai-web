 i even had this much like shit fine 
 for the road to riches and diamond rings 
 like we bought it all 
 the mistletoe's right here 
 come and have a toast for the douchebags,

 hard as a muthafucker, 
 let these niggas feel me 
 the best years of the low 
 imagine how you sound like me? 
 the second that's too heavy we ain't spoke a million
