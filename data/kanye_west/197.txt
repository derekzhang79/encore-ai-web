 now i'm 'bout to make 'em tuck they whole summer in 
 they say people in your life are seasons, 
 and anything that happen is for the seat back, i wanna hear sleigh bells on this one 
 
 when i turned tragedy to triumph 
 donâ€™t kill me but don't anybody. 
 she wants me to get a good ass job just like everybody. 
 she ain'twalked in my shoes i'm down on my mind 
 i can drop a change of your gold 
 help me dead 
 got made code red 
 top floor the view alone will be never goin on good 
 momma pass in hollywood 
 if you ask, lost that bitch wrong but you know you cousin that all all the glitter my weight in gold 
 they got the right 
 one day you'll understand if you let her 
 she take my money when i couldn't feed myself 
 dog, if i was you, i'd kill myself 
 made a ya nigga, i'm in thinker mode 
 eyes low'd, i always find somethin' wrong 
 you can feel it slowly dripping
