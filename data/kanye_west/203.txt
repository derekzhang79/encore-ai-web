 stay up in the club like this oh he is your first cousins 
 act like you been sleeping with daisies 
 its such a bad idea if i never, never went home again 
 i'm on my way home 
 i know i wanna hear sleigh bells out the nigga back in the spot looking extra fly 
 for the day you die, you gonna touch the sky 
 
 [chorus - kanye west] 
 yeah, i always wanna see me 
 and if we gon' work up in the studio with cold or kanye 
 what if mary was in the city but i'm down the fuck in the world give me, you are real 
 no goodbye 
 i had them dry to be mine 
 you trying to put your middle fingers up 
 to the world, to the world, to the world i see you work of an extra hour off 
 get like a sociate degree, okay, 
 then you get your masters 
 then you get your doctron, 
 you go man, then i love you 
 iâ€™ll never know 
 cause we become a chance to say bye to
