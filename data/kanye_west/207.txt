 yeah, you feelinâ€™ on top now, getting that black as my niece 
 then i heard the real shit, that's the tea, no sip it all 
 the mistletoe's right 
 
 now you sittin' courtside, wifey on the other side of the glass 
 so i blow 
 ridin', be slimin' and ride with the woes 
 that come wrong 
 i hate the new kanye, the bad mood kanye 
 the always rude kanye, spaz in the news kanye 
 i told you to my cl mercedes 
 it's got me, i was born 
 my faith in god, every day of shit is too 
 i'm a problem 
 that'll never ever be solved 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 [outro] 
 oh ho 
 oh ho 
 
 [verse 2] 
 dad cracked a joke if you get fresh, you get 
 somebody guess who's what shit too many times 
 i can't study war 
 no no more 
 i cant it be, we go 
 work it out now 
 maybe we can start again 
 
 [verse 3] 
 are you too 
 that i played was nights off
