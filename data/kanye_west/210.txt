 a case of ace, make them mad with camera 
 my nephew gone, my heart is torn 
 sometimes i wanted to 
 of that niggas with his radio face off

 all that power 
 the clock's tickin, i just count the hours 
 stop trippin' i'm tripping off the power 
 till then, fuck that the world's ours 
 pop the laugh in the end 
 cause i'm all up 
 people is passin'?

 bad bitch in the club 
 you don't mean a thing on the wall
