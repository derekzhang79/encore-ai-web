 abbey lee, too i’m rose 
 and these nigga's got shit that ask me in the slightest 
 i'm already tryna get closed 
 make them start jumpin up and down and sharin candy an' the you for love 
 when you don't really get mine 
 i hate the chain if i'd be a halle 
 you woulda been gone 
 home is where the hatred is 
 home is real bad news 
 
 oh jesus 
 we made it from the alley straight up to ballet 
 we at de bonny’s 
 end up in this bitch? 
 how many people her soul will eclipse the bullshit, they got his off, on money, shit that i’m up in the moment 
 i got before i still got a while 
 you need to real 
 so when i get my card back activated 
 i'm back out my coma 
 
 [bridge + hook] 
 i can't handle no liquor 
 but these bitches can't handle me 
 but gone when i'm in it and don't try to put me inline i already got crayons 
 my dad
