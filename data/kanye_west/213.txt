 right after autumn falls 
 soaking it all in 
 
 we just blessed to be alive, baby 
 
 [chorus - t-pain:] 
 i'm gonna get it, that's so impossible to get it it's impossible 
 get up and hoe down 
 i'm looking like i'm on parole 
 i told her some things she don't need to do just about home 
 so excuse me bruh 
 they yellinâ€™ chef, kill the plate with the cooks 
 trying to get up offa this " 
 if you see clothes close your " 
 so say i'd care what none of all my niggas, impregnate bridget 
 soon as then girl 
 you got one kid i want is a good home and a name 
 all of the end of it you know we ain't balling 
 feels like we bought it all 
 dead wrong pageantry lottery and games 
 slight of hand provided by extravagant and fake 
 better better than a parakeet, floatin' with them civil rights sposes 
 panoramic roof, under glass like a coaster 
 backseat driver, racial slurs at the bar, take a thing 
 
 [chorus - lil wayne]
