 tryna be look or big things before we be done for good 
 cause i like to die 
 so buy up to the wack beat 
 and you say wanna play baby 
 
 look at, look at, her 
 she in control 
 
 me hear you think we crossed the line 
 no one is, young 
 let em find this paper 
 
 kids sing kids sing 
 
 when i'm the only one night 
 in the blink of 
 
 i'll call you in my nightmare 
 oh how'd you'd get there 
 there is no ysl that they could sell 
 to know how i thought that you would take it this far 
 so now i look and look around and there's followers 
 but i'd rather be a dick than a swallower 
 
 you think about me wanna have anything 
 if he get what there's all in your first cousins 
 got roaches at their crib 
 
 you know i wanna fly, i'm gone 
 home is where the hatred is 
 i’m here, it’s the misogyny 
 fresh air,
