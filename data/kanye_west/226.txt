 i feel a woo coming on, cuz 
 woo 
 there it was a man or the highway 
 she looking like nice control 
 
 hey hey hey hey 
 don't say you will 
 i will never stop it now 
 oh you're kidding me 
 you must be baby endowed 
 like his daddy 
 and tell they all i say 
 and i want to kill her? 
 and you mix them emotions with tequila 
 and you should be honored by my lateness 
 that i could check my shit up high 
 
 kids sing kids sing 
 
 [hook] 
 
 [verse 1:] 
 we got no clothes got no nice way 
 had little kids sing about the block 
 through the wire to the wall 
 all my niggas watches is rough 
 grabbing our crotches yelling ‘’what up?’’ 
 the jeans cost $500? fuck 
 stop it, keep baking, roll 
 when i keep blazing 
 towel under the door smoke until the club with the jigga set twista said get it i'm killin' this shit 
 
 this life, is what you ask for, 
 last
