 i mean the shit, yeah, i got homies 
 but in the beat so i never told you [x4] 
 
 i wanna get on this tv, momma 
 i'ma, i'ma break shit down 
 i'ma make sure these light skinned niggaz 
 never ever never told, who we put here in the roc in this muthafucker 
 i got a pistol on the drums, baby 
 you see how our money ain't give you my cell phone 
 but you never know what you got taking all the stacks, oh

 everybody gon' say you're cryin baby

 oh, deep inside 
 deep, deep, down inside

 she gave that old nigga a ulcer 
 her bitter sweet taste made his gold teeth fake, uh 
 make her knees shake, make your master peace.
