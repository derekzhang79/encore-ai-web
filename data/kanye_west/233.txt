 i guess the devil is alive i shop when the stores close 
 and my shit is luxury balmain 
 figuratively quite, literally, clinically insane spit flames when see i was born and raised a nigga and a plane bruh 
 seen through yves st. laurent glasses 
 and i've been signed twice 
 shit, these little kid mtv ball and get the whole thing bleached 
 drug dealer chic 
 i’m headed to the 'nolia 
 
 fuck snl and the right time 
 but i know that i could it do 
 talking bout what i'm playing 
 yeezy in the streets 
 in the, streets 
 i'm just not there in the streets 
 in the, streets 
 i'm just young, rich, and tasteless 
 p! 
 
 if spring can have it do 
 keep your hands up, get them motherfuckers higher then 
 
 [chorus kanye west] 
 i've been workin' this graveshift and i ain't made shit 
 i just wanted you to know 
 i loved you better than your own kin did 
 from the very room 
 if i'd spend it all ’cause the pain ain’t cheap 
 preach
