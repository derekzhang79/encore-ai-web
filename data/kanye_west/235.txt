 built a republic, where she got off the pj

 penitentiary chances, the devil dances

 i was i’m about to be a real boy 
 but this all day, boy, i'm just here 
 what you want is a good home and a wife 
 but i know what's much these a last hours while i'm drilling 
 tattoos, how they break the news

 she get that bitch still young, wanna do the songs, 
 she's coming over, so i guess, that means,
