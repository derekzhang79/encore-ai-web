 cats think i'm high, i'm in thinker mode 
 hitting on her make up 
 she said you can't abort that my a new life for me 
 for the glory and let it 
 
 see i'm a motherfuckin' soldier 
 and i'ma be inside you â€˜fore you wake up 
 i got it place on my place 
 
 i just wanted better for my kids 
 and i know i act a fool 
 when you getting late mami, your screen saver say tweet 
 so i'm comin in when i feel like 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 [verse 3:] 
 how could you say wild oh you're the living 
 it's the way you doing my whole life that i could say it my new coat 
 cuz whenever i open the beef with the cane? 
 did strippers not make an ark when i made it rain? 
 don't let them accept the basics 
 plenty hoes in a baller-nigga matrix 
 invisibly set, the rolex is faceless 
 i'm just young, rich, and tasteless 
 p! 
 
 when if somebody go away turn it up!
