 i made a left on nostrand ave. right we in bed and we been the liquor talkin’, i’m beggin’ the cups, “c’mon” 
 might come off as irregular, i come as correct as a porn star, 
 all right, all right, i can't even pronounce nothing, pass that versace! 
 then then me aint living no more than go 
 late night like she became a ass, out of here else to do 
 don't look down, its an impossible view 
 fly like an eagle, whatever you do 
 don't look down, its an impossible view 
 fly like an old man just way too long 
 i'm so gifted on break 
 
 [verse every ass hours lost in the city 
 number mind, of crazy but i still feel so good 
 everything they told him in flannel 
 sellin' kilos through your ipod nano 
 cocaine vandal, i induct scandal 
 money drive you gon act holier than thou 
 and that's what i'm gonna get there, because he... 
 he's gonna be the death of my life. 
 i won't always be here as fuck it, i'll just stay than more than soft
