 i gotta call her names, names, i hate you, more. 
 let's call her names, names, names, i hate you, more. 
 let's call her names, names, names, i hate you, more. 
 let's call her names, names, i hate you, more.

 just peep this, preach us, teach us, he's a loner, baby girl, he's a new movement 
 being led and be work 
 30 hours

 she cut me the country 
 so you got to work no more 
 and that's one thing that you know 
 that i should have everything i gotta sounds and 13's 
 put up in my mind i hope 
 i told you four times, don't test me, hoe 
 now we finna lose all self-control 
 but you can still be who you wish you is 3 years old
