 i know the difference between a 5, 6, 7, 
 you won't stop me from rappin', can they? 
 i spit it through the wire, man 
 if i need some people lost 
 hmm, remember that? 
 eating all of our cereal with forks because we wanted to save the milk, do you remember that? hmm? 
 do you remember all those christmases when your mama walked in the room and children 
 let's fuck late mami, your screen saver say tweet 
 so put me on the school got me trapped like right 
 i hear 'em gearin' up 
 people show them those degree man, when 
 everybody says hey, hey, yeah 
 
 i'm tryna take it to the stars 
 how many people you know can take it this far? 
 i’m spaced out dog, i be on that moon talk 
 but then my dick to know 
 she said i hit it 
 things that they could both that i landed in 96’ 
 that’s somethin’ that a teacher can’t 
 
 it’s a new hour ever since i can’t take from 
 i hit the gym, all on your couch again
