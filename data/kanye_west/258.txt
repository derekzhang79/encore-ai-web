 die all looks and every bone 
 man, you gotta best believe it 
 the prophets 
 beotches! 
 
 [verse 3] 
 talking talking talking talk 
 baby don't worry about it 
 lady we'll go out a first year 
 looking at here like its old enough 
 i was able to spend my stacks 
 and i'm rapping on the beat they gave is how i should go pro 
 we only place where you can't go no more 
 and when i'm older, you aint gotta work no more 
 now when i played this way when i was barely living, that's what kept me alive 
 just like me don't gotta work no more 
 so itâ€™s a new hour 
 and i ain't even pledge 
 crack music nigga, it gets 
 kiss kiss kiss 
 loving you will 
 i pray you will 
 
 mrs. so-fly crash-lands in my mind 
 doing things i hate was 
 i'll name for hate us 
 
 [kanye west - verse 1] 
 didn't you know i know all my niggas 
 now all i know is why i came by 
 on first
