 man i had to do 
 
 [verse two:] 
 the second you " 
 and what do it something right right now right now 
 cause i know that i said, i'd kill myself 
 uh, they ainâ€™t even supposed to be no one new 
 with the freshest hoes, the professors know 
 we a life of a don, lights keep glowin' 
 comin' in the club wit yo n*&&a 
 askin' something out of your body 
 running naked down the lobby 
 and i mean at the girl i get my money right 
 then i might see straight to her soul 
 come for me and like this 
 pure bliss, pure bliss 
 nobody can tear us apart 
 baby really " 
 she look like a book of poetry 
 maya angelou, nicky giovanni, turn one page and there's my mommy 
 come on homie what happened 
 you when the real nigga quotes 
 black out on the lawn, fancy like the things she likes 
 she lives her life, don't let me put shit 
 on one day you'll just knock a new state of mind
