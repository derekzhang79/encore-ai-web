 play it gotta make it this far 
 so many scars 
 ‘bout to take this whole thing to go 
 so we won’t take the whole thing bleached 
 drug dealer chic 
 i’m headed to miami to fuck up the fontaine bleu 
 a case of ace, make them come and fuck up the phone, i got you out my mind 
 and the devil stay testing 
 black on black, black broads 
 all what's at the rooms at the cyberus, 
 from this jacuzzi you gone be out now 
 cause i can see it 
 so now we smart 
 we only makin' the wrong side 
 i hold in my mind 
 and then they love to give my new phone 
 for all the monologue 
 all that talkin is gon' need no bouncers 
 nothing less than a motherfucker 
 high in this flow 
 that's the tea, no sip 
 don't trip, don't trip, that pussy slippery, no whip 
 we ain't balling 
 feels like we bought it all 
 the mistletoe's right here 
 come give a picture with steve pay no tax 
 chi-town 'til i'm on
