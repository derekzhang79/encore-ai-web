 my nephew gone, my heart is torn 
 sometimes i seems to the stars sitting in we corner 
 feel on i love you and the more fame, i only see 
 that i know i'm gone off 
 leave your block off 
 showinâ€™ the light skinned slave, boy, her nickname 
 never did this before, that's what the virgin says 
 we've been generally warned, that's what the first one my little brother came through and kicked my bezel up 
 let's slow em on the keys, hey 
 they say i'm possessed, it's an omen 
 i keep it true 
 i got what you need 
 wassup, wassup, wassup, wassup 
 
 [jay-z kanye west)] 
 looks like a panda 
 going nowhere to worry around 
 but you found it muthafucker 
 oh ho 
 oh ho 
 
 feeling you look at you like this 
 'ey what a bam bam 
 that benz was in zion 
 i wish her heart still was in rhymin' 
 yeah i'm all to really pull the race card 
 you can still be who you
