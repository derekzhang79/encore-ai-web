 let's take it all the way back to hello 
 they say i'm too young for love 
 and we finna lose all self-control 
 but you got something new to see? 
 and you make it up outta the streets 
 the phillip lim remind a fairy tale 
 but these hoes love to 
 i feel a woo coming on, cuz 
 woo 
 there it was the tree, huh? 
 remember that? hmm? 
 do you remember when your good life 
 black on black murder again 
 
 [jay-z:] 
 them a real night starts when i go to sleep sleep sleep 
 always thank the city, haters wish they know, they know i’m the ones chosen 
 so we’ll never agree again 
 till then i’ll be fly when easter’s over 
 i tried to have all that power 
 the first trying 
 but i'm looking for more 
 somewhere i can feel her 
 i hate when i leave, i smell like a an about the girl that love 
 
 [hook] 
 
 [chorus - t-pain] 
 
 [verse 2] 
 how could you do it
