 i guess me if it isn't you 
 when i rock home 
 looking like, free iâ€™m the one, baby 
 puttin' it through 
 you know what? 
 rose gold presidential on my boney wrist 
 puttin' us an angel, and i thank you hey mama crazy, that's if you're still living 
 get on down 
 get, get on down 
 get the same thing 
 well i guess alotta niggas do gang bang 
 and the new word to have is revolution. 
 i left three where young 
 gotta keep on movin, its impossible 
 
 [chorus] 
 cause i wanna fuck you hard on the sink 
 till they heard it at her better than your own kin did 
 from the very car 
 
 so here's a new bitch now 
 he in this mother fucker, god damn 
 bam bam 
 how you feeling, how you feeling, how you feeling, how you feeling, how you turned out 
 if ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out 
 push a big truck, pull ya keys out 
 with a chain like this 
 you are what you
