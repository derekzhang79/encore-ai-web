 see i invented kanye, it wasn't any kanyes 
 and now that i don't see just how we feel the man i put monie in 
 we go through too much bullshit just to mess with these drunk and hot girls 
 a need to kanye's workout tape 
 i been able to stop for the slaves that i did 
 but i'm not lovin' you the way i wanted to 
 gotta keep mine in ’cause he getting three white bitches 
 you're the only way
