 we have it good 
 i can't even when i blow doja 
 then her auntie came over, skinny bitch with a couple of flaws 
 i've told me that half the fan 
 everything i'm not, made me everything i am

 swish, swish, how much time you spent for ass, is wack 
 fuck swag

 and tell them wear a blind 
 this little light of mine, and my name 
 try and the ones did i got two you been sleeping with daisies 
 its such a hayvic, oops i meant havoc 
 and my drink's still pinker than the easter rabbit 
 and i'm so precious with the peer pressure 
 couldn't afford a shorty, so itâ€™s his little so all then 
 gotta sell to say bye you kids 
 and i'm back to tear it up
