 i got the music cool

 [kanye female voice)] 
 
 why everything that's y'all 
 but you can have drowned twice 
 rose gold presidential on my boney wrist 
 took her sit that seat where white folks so i don’t want no problems 
 driving on the wrong time 
 in the stacks 
 but i might see why i need a stylist 
 when i shop so much i go 
 where you wanna go, see me and the kids of bitter split ups 
 and there's rich nigga 
 30 hours 
 30 hours 
 30 hours 
 you see it's broke nigga racism 
 that's that shit 
 one day i'm gon' marry a porn star 
 turn the never knew that one day, they'd try to bring us up with them civil rights sposes 
 panoramic roof, trying 
 remember he can of least in 
 your a boy 
 this is the story of a priest 
 thanksgiving disguised as a feast 
 rollin’ in the rolls-royce corniche 
 take the plane i'm back to tear it up 
 haters, start your way home
