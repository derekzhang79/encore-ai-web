 why its gone and they be ran with some actresses niggas that's kanye 
 the penthouses are poolside with palm trees

 if i go outside, i got the right 
 and the hoes was the wrong thing 
 you worry bout the wrong things, the wrong things 
 you got to roll with the buy to play 
 somebody would've told you to do something up lifting 
 i’m trynna get you out here with these white people and this show for a minute 
 we will not even 
 that's why you're up tonight
