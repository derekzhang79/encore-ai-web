 i got an aunt ruth that can't remember why i was born and my best spot looking for the best spot 
 bitches in the day 
 got your hands to the constellations 
 they way you look at my life, 
 yeah i'm 52, so what, hate all you want, 
 but i'm smart, i'm so smart, and i'm in school, 
 and these niggas is alive for all that i can see 
 her love is only fire, when i keep blazing 
 see, that's just the dick 
 but a thing, another plane, my passport on pivot 
 as long as i'm on parole 
 i told detroit you'll fuck my money back activated 
 they in your coochie 
 i swear to day to have the fire 
 you know big more of that gutter shit 
 
 new rihanna in the front 
 bitches in the back don't like me though 
 
 [kanye west:] 
 sun don't shine 
 we be in the room 
 what's the time 
 all these fancy things 
 i got my suit and tie 
 hundred thousand dollar pair of shoes, we made a million a minute,
