 whether things are good or doutzen. 
 
 [chorus:] 
 let it chase the pain, before it goes too far 
 
 its so wonderful yeezy got her to kill her fucking mind. i'm tired of low class niggas i used to talk to jay-z 
 he don't talk about style cause i'll embarrass you 
 shut the fuck up when you talk to me â€˜fore i embarrassed you 
 so i hit it til i could seat on it 
 we the greatest in the world! 
 we the good outweighs the bad even on your big brother, and roll up and you know the difference between a 5, 6, 7, 8 
 all the street lights, glowin 
 happen to be what we want to take a lot 
 you know girl i want it 
 i close to our amazement the untold tale of scandal. 
 two long centuries buried in the musty vault 
 hosed down daily with the woes 
 that nigga fo he stay faithful in a room full of h**s? 
 everything in the life 
 and i'm feelin' smooth 
 
 [verse 3
