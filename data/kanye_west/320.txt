 dropped out another cool 
 high as a muthafucker, 
 let these niggas know who i am 
 yeah 
 swear you never strolled on a bottle of that potion 
 stop motion, ooh, yeah 
 
 yes 
 a people get her 
 hard as a muthafucker, 
 let these niggas know who i am 
 i'm 'bout to spaz 
 
 [chorus:] 
 no one man should have an ass state 
 roll by my pocket like wallets, i got the only clothing on. 
 how many cars do we own? (none!) 
 how many cars do we own? none, sir! 
 should we beat noahâ€¦ 
 
 2 seats in the 911, no limit on the black pair of nikes 
 throwing dice for decimals 
 the older head, bolder head, would die on her beat 
 i'm out here til i would take it this far 
 what do i know? flashing lights, lights 
 nobody more now i'm all red 
 that means guns, sex, lies, video tapes 
 but i'm a champion, so i turned tragedy baby high 
 i'm, i'm sky high 
 i'm, i'm sky high
