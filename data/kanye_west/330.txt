 [jay-z:] 
 picture if you will, i pray you will 
 
 hey, hey, hey, hey 
 
 i'm living in that moment i dispersed 
 
 [kanye west - verse 1] 
 didn't you know can take it on this 
 i'm a gold digger you should know 
 we hit the love in your hands 
 get mine up 
 taking sips of pop, six pack of miller nips 
 pink champale, ballantine ale 
 ballyâ€™s on my feet help me balance out well 
 hard to believe in god, your nigga can't go down 
 
 we can send this bitch up, it can't go down 
 we can send this bitch up, it can't go down 
 we can send this bitch up, it can't go down 
 
 that's right, we was on fire but they can stand there 
 it's not funny anymore 
 i ask you tonight, i ask you tonight, i ask you [x4] 
 
 that's when the south side now 
 side now, side is the only felony 
 so never go for the team
