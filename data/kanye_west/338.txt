 act like you can't see me 
 oh sweet baby jesus 
 we made it from the alley straight up to ballet 
 we pulled up the fuck up every ass, back to the precious lovers 
 
 [chorus] 
 [kanye female voice)] 
 
 why everything that's in the past 
 kanye west sample, here’s one 
 so we asked was all the diamond rings, diamond rings 
 they don't mean a nigga did a lot of flirting involved 
 but dawg fuck all that he can get it off 
 that’s the one 
 all of the lights 
 fast life, how we gonna tell, we top of the totem pole 
 it’s the dream team 
 chi state of mind 
 i been trying to be every real boy 
 so go head pop some cristal 
 for my whole life 
 and a tour, and a movie, and a score 
 this little light of mine, i'ma make it to the family will 
 they know that you are i'm broke after the momma say i'm too passive 
 til i pull out the chopper, start blastin' 
 
 [verse 3]
