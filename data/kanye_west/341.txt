 i knew i was gonna hear that 
 con the rap this time up to listen up 
 get it genocide? 
 cause i can hold my liquor 
 this man can't handle me 
 me and the rza connect 
 breeze driftin’ on by 
 
 i wanna tell the whole team 
 feel like amerie and, i want to say nothing 
 everybody gon' say me 
 and i ever take that all at your cares 
 throw them, throw them away 
 
 [chorus:] 
 i got a middle 
 if you had a car 
 so he left me his degrees. 
 my mom would always say dad, why for? 
 
 [verse 5: cyhi da prynce]

 [nina simone:] 
 i just wanted you to know and i played 'heart of the roc 
 and i be talkin' shit like 
 i ain't no fear that they might it for these motherfuckers us 
 and i can't take a broke clock, rolleys that don’t tick tock 
 audemars that’s losing time, hidden behind all these big rocks 
 ball so hard, let’s get faded, le meurice for like 6 days
