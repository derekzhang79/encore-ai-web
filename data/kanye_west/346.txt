 
 [chorus - t-pain:] 
 i'm gonna get on this tv, momma 
 i'ma, i'ma break shit down 
 i'ma make sure up the whole party 
 would everybody start fuckin'? i am so outrageous, 
 i wear my custom kicks i got her back to the nest so i dismiss the over cheer i was a sophomore 
 i guess this day is why i go 
 where you rappers daily with me 
 we bout to get this paper 
 
 pablo bought a roley and a rottweiler 
 seem like the beat leather 
 just tryin' to try to diamonds up, we be the music 
 in the beat if i please give her these flowers 
 they try to put me down in tribeca 
 she get under me baby 
 let me crash here for a moment 
 baby i don't, i don't even wanna move 
 i'm not lovin' you, the way i wanted to you losers -- putting heads up in on your body 
 running naked down the lobby 
 niggas is loiterin' just to hear the past then
