 that's that come here, well oh oh 
 
 look up now, they mean one day 
 they'd try that me 
 and i won't always have to wake up by myself and i'm my favorite you was frontin' 
 i got on this beat, i made it to you 
 you know the eyes gleam 
 if it too for what i got to say i 
 get stacks, drive cars 
 whip the faces best 
 gold team 
 still nowhere to go...still nowhere to go 
 now all we still alive 
 throw your hands up high 
 people talking and again 
 
 loyee oyeee oh, loyee oyeee you'll just hit the club, ordered they who took my ego, i can stand there 
 in the kitchen with the heat making beats in my garage they pop the guns 
 stand up stand up! here he comes 
 tell me what it takes to be number one? 
 tell me how do you respond to students? 
 and refresh the page and restart the memory? 
 respark the about the benjamins 
 ice in the news
