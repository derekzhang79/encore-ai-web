 
 [verse 1] 
 the night is young, what the fuck right now? 
 what the, what the fuck right now? 
 what the fuck right now? 
 what if we not up 
 the only thing the radio now the devil in paris 
 
 can we get the smash this fuck's for you 
 i'm with the girl she make calls out the sky, that's that shit probably worse 
 is these nigga's more than the models 
 the good news? 
 y'all sleeping on me, huh? had a bad reputation 
 walking 'round, always mad reputation 
 leave a pretty girl sad reputation 
 start a lexus 
 she in rhyme 
 hard to a real boy 
 pinocchio story is, i just want to say nothing 
 everybody gon' say how you feelin, how you can die 
 got friends sitting in red hours 
 but it's really putting it 
 we let me go, let me go 
 if you will never stop it now 
 
 [chorus - t-pain] 
 
 [verse 2] 
 i got a new friend, well i got homies 
 but in the end it's time and now,
