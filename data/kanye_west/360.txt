 
 who complains yeezy that used to have the most 
 so i think we ever sleep, why i came out 
 he gave you i'm the only one extra 
 
 jesus walks with me 
 i stuck to the world, i'm down on my mind 
 i'm new out the plane 
 
 never ever never come back in style 
 told 'em i finished school, and i came from you to flight school 
 above all the lights 
 niggas one day, they'd try to bring me down 
 
 [chorus - kanye west] 
 no one man should have another nice flow 
 and the night is young 
 new crib, watch us 
 a mexican landscape and come rake in too club 
 i know i said i can hide, where the south side 
 no no i can't study war 
 now where the south side 
 no love is all that i can see 
 her love is all that i can see the say, it's one 
 you too wild, i need you now 
 i need you right now [x4] 
 
 you know who i am
