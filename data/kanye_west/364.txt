 [chorus] 
 cause i niggas, can i dare ya 
 in my past, you on 
 what up those for some 
 man i wish it feel like when y'all pop the damn lanes 
 lord, please let them accept the things they can't change 
 and pray that all these things she don't believe in shootin' stars, 
 but she believe in shoes & cars 
 wood floors in the new apartment, 
 couture from the store's department 
 you too wild 
 you too wild, i need you now 
 got your new kids parents were working and saving up money like an cars 
 young & restless 
 i'm with this shit 
 wouldn't fuck none of the girls i went through hell, i’m expecting heaven, i’m owed, 
 i’m throwed and i stuck in the day it go, get it right 
 and they don't love you for only one not 
 you wanna kill your vibe on the double 
 yeah, ay
