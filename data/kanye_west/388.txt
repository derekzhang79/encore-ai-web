 you tried to tell you right now before you give it up 
 
 cause they donâ€™t really matter, she fine homes 
 why the hell is if you play crazy you been sleeping with daisies 
 its such a hayvic, oops i meant havoc 
 and my drink's still pinker than the easter rabbit 
 and i'm just tryin' to make it past 25 but the baby, the hood wonder somebody go away 
 then i get bleach on my t-shirt 
 i'mma feel like god wrote this 
 i'm just on a nigga in turn 
 gold back in the house got 'em showin off 
 i'm like a touched up jag, shit 
 this is my momma shit; i used to hear these niggas 
 merry christmas, then i found out 
 we found out 
 we found out 
 we found out 
 we found out 
 we found out 
 there's light with no heat 
 we cooled out, it's cool out 
 life is precious 
 we found out, we found out 
 we found out 
 we found out 
 we found out 
 we found out 
 we found out
