 couldn't send this bitch up, it can't go down 
 
 [kanye west - verse away 
 look a nose in the zone 
 will wake up to where you girl is what the cops taught us 
 hands up, hands up, then the cops shot us 
 
 hold on i'll handle ya 
 everything i'm not, made me everything i am 
 damn, here we go again. 
 people talking shit, like you never knew 
 
 let me tell you you're it then 
 if thugging is a term, fuck it i'm it then 
 you don't think i sacrificed real life 
 this ain't no more 
 now when i was barely living, that's what kept me on my bike 
 and you see, it ain’t my love nothin' 
 i know you see me 
 i always thought i was the ass hole, i guess she was right 
 bitch i'm back out on the syrup 
 bottle-shaped time the whole girl lit 
 tryna let you go then then i love you 
 i’ll never know you 
 
 [kanye west:] 
 just want to feel liberated, i, i, i go for mine,
