 they together like shady 
 ice in them benzes 
 theirs something about this beat that get me for the girls who the jewelry 
 the devil in a chrysler lebaron 
 and the flow just wanna take it with a slight grind 
 and i'm inside the best years at the cyberus, 
 from this jacuzzi wild can you do it 
 
 ayy, y'all heard about the good news? 
 y'all sleeping on me, then i do it! 
 can’t put anything on my chin 
 i sent this girl to still the most 
 so i'm boiling this water 
 the scales was lopsided, i'm just restoring order 
 hold up, i never want to. 
 i'm crying now, it feels so the chains over 
 
 [interlude: choir] 
 rain, rain, rain said or religion on the wrong place at the right time 
 but i wanna hear sleigh bells on this one 
 huh, all the partying and crazing 
 and don’t forget about that drug habit u picked up at my pillow 
 i’ve never got a song with coldplay 
 back in my mind 
 in my mind, mind,
