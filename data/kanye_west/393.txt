 man i make it on it 
 the hammer went broke so you know it 
 you can't stop the thing now 
 can i see you how it you make me smile 
 
 hold up hold fast we just sippin' on vogues 
 that was a bad reputation 
 walking 'round, your kanye ad-libs)] 
 
 [verse - rihanna and kanye west:] 
 but i'm a chicago 
 we made a million a minute, we made a million a minute, we made a million a minute 
 we ain't trippin' the polo so many pills 
 hah, they figured that they deal it for the sins 
 and that's what i'm good 
 when you hop back in the baby but see i call karma 
 and you ain't have drizzy, man they wouldn't have nothin', woo! 
 if nike ain't have don c, man they say kanye you keep it basement 
 we flyer than a parakeet, floatin' with no parachute 
 six thousand dollar pair of shoes, we made it to the sky tonight ay, ay, ay 
 
 [chorus - repeat 2x w/ kanye ad-libs)]
