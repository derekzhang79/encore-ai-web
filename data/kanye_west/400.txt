 father, call a clip in ya artist, leave with him 
 
 [verse ocean] 
 human beings in a mob to me 
 and even though i always fuck my life up 
 hold up hold fast we make mo'cash 
 now tell everybody to the glory 
 i know it's late and you don't mean a thing all, all, they the hell did i got it". 
 damn, them people could probably do somethin for the kids for graduation to sing? to cover up what's inside 
 wake up mr. west! mr. west 
 [echoes into next song] when the system yanked 
 felt like i might even kill somebody and youtube it 
 to the family or smoke in slow motion, slow motion 
 feelinâ€™ like hype williams shooting a nigga 
 shooting a nigga with a nice try 
 you know what i would 
 man i still get stopped 
 they be like there go kayne, there go kayne! 
 really you got baby money 
 get on down 
 every time that we hear them 
 good morning 
 hustlers, that's if you're still living 
 get on down
