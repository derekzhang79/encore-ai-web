 maybe that's why to put some motherfucking jimmy choos on? 
 diamonds blue, business managerâ€™s jewish 
 and if you don't wanna do the wrong way i can fuck it we hustle for change 
 the long centuries buried in the musty vault 
 hosed down daily with no spray 
 and aint no loans for sittin your ass at home 
 
 man i make them, i shall hayve them 
 oops i meant havoc 
 and my drink's still pinker than the easter rabbit 
 and i'm so far from the 'go kanye 
 chop up the soul kanye, set on his goals kanye 
 i ever told can try that how he gave you i don't see why i need a stylist 
 when i shop so she got you homie 
 i'm looking for more than half past you clowns 
 look, i ain't doing some shit 
 so if the devil wear prada, 
 adam eve out on the he can kill me 
 my degree keeps me satisfied 
 when i can cop that how much head, i wouldn't get out that's all them can do 
 don't look down, its an impossible
