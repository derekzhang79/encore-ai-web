 as i look down when my feet get weary 
 cause i can't handle no liquor 
 but these niggas from kids more to 
 bad bitch, you dig that 
 get stacks, drive cars 
 whip a deep depression when my mamma passed 
 suicide that lock it in 
 when we could not eat 
 hmm, remember that? 
 eating all of our eyes, follow my erick sermon 
 did moses not part the fanta 
 credit cards because the scammers 
 asking me 
 making beats for the porsche go 
 ha, i got something new to show 
 i'll be on this flight like a month right now 
 stupid so your ray girl been hot no you 
 
 [verse 1 - kanye west] 
 yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 yeah, my face turnt to stone 
 when i see it 
 cause even when i get my money right 
 when i pulled up to the valet, we'll teach our daughter ballet 
 we'll raise us a beyonce, maybe she'll be a whole family on that funeral line 
 ask the truth on the plane now 
 hold up, hold
