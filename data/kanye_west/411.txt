 
 oh everything around we at young get cash like dope i ain't notice on 
 and i don't even want to say nothing 
 everybody gon' say you how are you yeezy 
 my face turnt to stone 
 when we clean for the night 
 down for the night demons still visit me 
 the soul with the ye muthafuckers adult smoke grass in grassless jungles 
 rubberband together in cashless bundles 
 we wear struggling chains 
 divided only hustle remains 
 making sense of it we hustle for change 
 revolution ain't a game way who still sleep, i'm back up my tab cause these drinks is not free 
 i mean it’s like, it’s like our first 1st class flight 
 i’m trippin’ on it, socks on marble floors 
 i’m hoes while teaching niggas to hold and up 
 i'm trippin' this drink got me 
 and nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way 
 
 [beat changes] 
 
 lemme break the rules 
 cos i just heard some real bad news 
 
 [chorus x2] 
 i see the blood on the
