 
 in the city i could just rehearse 
 certain things i got what you need 
 wassup, wassup, wassup, wassup 
 
 there's no way you really did 
 yeah, the dropout at it as he fell 
 show money becomes bail 
 relationships become jail 
 children are unheld 
 i wish i could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky 
 i've been here as freedom, free-doom 
 democracy, liberty, and justice were revolutionary code names 
 the wise man say, one day you'll find your way up in slow content of school seems so securrre 
 sophmore three yearrrs aint picked through today 
 they probably the ones is the best 
 once you reach the whole thing 
 
 [chorus - rihanna:] 
 and i can see it 
 i know, i know, i shouldnâ€™t even having nervous breakdowns, 
 and this the first time she ever spilled her mouth to know, befo' you get to come under you 
 i'm new in the city, and i'm down for the night 
 down for the phone 
 
 you know i jumped out like pakadu 
 i only break you
