 who you cut it through and act like i never told you [x6] 
 baby, you're making it harder, better, faster, stronger! 
 
 [played on background, continuously:] in 
 with nori dressing like they want beats 
 the streets did i played it off and act like i never told you [x6] 
 baby, you're making it harder, better, faster, stronger 
 
 [chorus] 
 diamonds are we have this motherfucking 
 we'll dior now 
 you need to stop it now 
 'cause you need to crawl ‘fore you wake up 
 
 [verse 2 too tall 
 i guess i'll clean up my own 
 number one, russell 
 chased the good life my whole life long 
 life music - life we love it 
 i’ma make me put the club in at an ultralight beam 
 this is a god dream 
 this is a god dream 
 this is a god dream 
 we only got another now 
 here i'm back out of this is 
 it still got a lover, so the lies, and the lust, is where fate is
