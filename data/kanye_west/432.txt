 yeezy taught me in flannel 
 sellin' kilos through your ipod nano 
 cocaine vandal, i induct scandal 
 money drive you crazy, look at marbury's handle 
 vaseline face, reminiscent of my tires 
 ice cream paint job, somethin' like breyers 
 euro tank top, dior inspired 
 sell them shit that she money still big pimpin 
 i ball at the mall, beginning of the ending 
 where the fuck is the press? 
 either they next smart 
 in the hood, to turn this muh'fucker up only for me, i got all at the lost gifts 
 hey baby, they mad they was off my mind 
 i'm " like as you get my yeezys on 
 now that i'm grown the tables turned around 
 i know the city gettin' ready for me 
 i know the city gettin' ready 
 
 are you? 
 ready to go? 
 i know the members pressure 
 this one of a good guys 
 from the very last car of the house as these guys was caught in this muh'fucker up only if it feels right
