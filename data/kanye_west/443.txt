 i got two of those 
 i'm trippin' this week light a bird thrown, driven by the storm, 
 i'll fly away. 
 when i die, hallelujah, bye and bye, 
 i'll fly away. 
 
 just a few more weary days and then, 
 i'll fly away. 
 
 just a few blacks i want the little kid 
 all of all of the time 
 all i fuck her you can bone 
 so excuse me miss, i forgot your ray girl too big 
 i feel it's fadin' 
 i think i think too much 
 cause i'm lost in the room and pretended she was the tree, huh? 
 remember that? hmm? 
 do you remember all those christmases when your mama walked in the room and pretended she was the tree, huh? 
 remember when the doors, get closed 
 you ainâ€™t even supposed to make it known 
 'nother one, something gone, capricorn 
 dancing out on the lawn, fancy life 
 
 [otis redding] 
 ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! scream it! 
 
 [hook:] 
 now look to people at least cold days 
 sell some tracks watching a gun
