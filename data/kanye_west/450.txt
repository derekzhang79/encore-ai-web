 can't you see i'm dating having problems of my life. 
 i won't always have to prove it,ugh 
 
 you got enough else to do anything for a motherfuckin’ fool if you wanna, 
 cool off thinkin' we local, come up and down and sharin candy an' her muthafucker 
 you're my freedom, you're the damn 
 
 i see the glasses, so obvious 
 about my little brother 
 get that nigga come 
 well i'm trying to watch my sodium 
 die high blood pressure either let the feds catch ya (yeah) 
 i'm amazing born on a full moon 
 i was breed to get it in, no spoon 
 that's why we hear them 
 good morning 
 hustlers, that's if you're always do at the he at the sunshine? 
 
 ohhhhh i smile 
 when roses come to see me 
 and i ain't get the memo? yeezy’s back in my body i would think i'm too passive 
 til i pull out the chopper, start blastin'
