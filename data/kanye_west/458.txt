 they fuck a beat like collagen 
 say it! 
 we can't afford no gas! 
 so we could both show off 
 but i never thought that you could see 
 fuck the shit i saw growing up 
 and i want the issue, they unload the shit 
 and i've realized that i've arrived, cuz 
 it take more than a magazine to kill more 
 to make our largest star show what we can come with the sisters 
 nah, you ain't listen, 'bout him 
 one friends 
 i guess i should've forgot where i came from. 
 
 [chorus:] 
 la, la, la, la then you cant tell me nothing 
 let me crash here for the moment 
 i lost in the streets, it ain't me 
 follow em on your sofa 
 the game getting foul up like vegas 
 seen through the eyes of rebel glasses 
 pray to god that my arms reach the masses 
 the young smoke grass in grassless jungles 
 rubberband together in cashless bundles 
 we wear struggling chains 
 divided only hustle remains
