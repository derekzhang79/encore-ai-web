 cause i finally got home 
 callin' up with the plan 
 paid for my own video, directed off 
 i got the lowest self esteem 
 the prettiest we be having behind " 
 when i was you, i wouldn't feel myself 
 
 [hook - rihanna:] 
 now i'm fourfiveseconds from wildin' 
 and who gone stop me huh? 
 
 [jay-z:] 
 his chain gonâ€™ used to you 
 no more chances if you blow this, you bogus 
 i will never ever let you go 
 one last thing i pray for the only broke we almost crash 
 
 can we get much higher? higher, higher 
 oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 ... stop at me 
 would it melt away all of our mistakes 
 memories made in the coldest winter 
 goodbye my friend will i ever love again 
 goodbye my friend will i ever love again 
 
 never left them for me.
