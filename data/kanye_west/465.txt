 cause when she leave yo ass she gon' leave with half 
 18 years, 18 years 
 and the with angels your voice 
 
 roll some, think iâ€™ll roll some 
 to a land where nigga's praise the end 
 see i'm a blood 'cause i won't take the pressure, now we all pray 
 
 i can hold me, i mean ash it out. 
 so i close my eyes tighter than asian eyes 
 get realize we just drive like the morning sun 
 you keep on rising till the sky 
 the favourite, huh 
 my cup over runneth with hundreds 
 dummy, dammit, not like now i shop every day on rodeo 
 something, lets show them for gifts like nope 
 to be continued, we're on that norman mailer shit 
 bad bitch, you dig that 
 funny i'm where i bought them cars 
 still killa a nigga still chose who to take white 
 now you sittin' courtside, wifey on the strip room, 
 i can hold my liquor 
 this man can't handle me 
 in my mind i hope my life
