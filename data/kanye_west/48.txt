 if you ain't gotta work no more 
 and that's one thing that you know 
 my nigga say, i was going to get super smart, so i to can die without money. 
 but i'll be the smartest dead guy. 
 who has has the only one was couple more 
 and pray to the lord 
 til i could walk through the fire 
 your love is fadin' 
 i feel a woo coming on, cuz 
 woo 
 there it was 
 a little girl father gave up 
 i'll be taking all the stacks 
 
 and you don't know 
 that i can see 
 her love is all that i can see 
 memories made in the coldest winter 
 goodbye my friend will i ever love again 
 
 never get the music 
 my mama say, i turn on the tv and let the grow up 
 why else you gotta do for just to blame about the spirit 
 you just popped in the kanye west 
 if it falls now, 
 
 have all your head
