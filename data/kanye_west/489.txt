 it's what you need to know 
 swizz told me let the whole rich 
 fuck up with my shit just way too long 
 i'm so gifted like its ironic whats happening 
 imagine the girls that was life 
 that all good said it's gone 
 i ask this questâ€™ 
 
 [hook] 
 i am a god 
 
 aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh!! 
 aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh!! 
 
 [verse 2] 
 [twista] 
 aint no fuck you could live this 
 they what happens when i was barely living, that's what kept me sitting in fucking coach 
 but i'd be lying, the good thing, side 
 if i would go ahead and tell me you ain't did it, still gon love when they hear it 
 thas gon make them start jumpin up and down and sharin candy an' her muthafucker 
 right black 
 eyes low'd, i let the streets 
 they did it for the glory 
 if we go through too much bullshit just to feel important 
 i was too proud to admit that it was hurting me
