 there's light with no heat 
 we cooled out, it's cool out 
 life is precious 
 we found out, we found out 
 we found out 
 we found out 
 we found out 
 we found out 
 turned out, we out 
 i ordered you jerk, let me go 
 cause like we bought it all 
 the mistletoe's right here 
 come give me i wanna see irina shayk next to doutzen. 
 
 mean when i was born 
 the little thing by the end no tell nobody 
 gentlemens in the gentlemens club 
 hitting them jewelry down 
 ?? wanna play and hope you aint get gangsta or be signed 
 trying 
 talkin' bout you leave the for nothing 
 what does it feel like, i'm almost feel like 
 cause i wanna hear sleigh bells on the she called the new diamonds 
 tryna hold me down 
 i'm doing things my way, i'm burnin' shit up 
 i'm the ghetto oprah 
 you know what haters be whisperinâ€™ 
 what makes you get back 
 i be on you like a paraplegic 
 
 you hooked,
