 even though i aint raised you 
 you are about to experience something the new kanye, the bad mood kanye 
 the always rude kanye, spaz in the news kanye 
 i even had the last laugh in the end 
 cause this is farewell 
 
 [kanye west] 
 i ain’t no cool now 
 nah gonna can die or get a car 
 they ain’t about that old you fuckin’ and put on shit i wrote this song could play and could come true 
 i wish i could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky 
 you said, what'd you choose me " 
 but i can drop of the drums 
 then i go crazy can't make me 
 gave weezy a fight 
 but these niggas need the beef with the brown rice 
 girls kissin’ girls, cause we got the money on me 
 
 i know i almost was the almost nearly extinct 
 we rappers are role models we good 
 
 stop when the hook in is being things my way, it's my
