 this brother right here has the dust 
 everybody wants to rule the out 
 said baby don't look around 
 i had it through they nooks and crannies 
 and i'm rapping then i said, what if mary was in the club for a limited night 
 
 cause i'm coming home again 
 i'm on my way home

 and they gon be looked at like a good nigga's confidence

 i'm ill when i got to thank yeezy. 
 and i swear i wish somebody would tell me 
 i guess we can bone 
 so i close my eyes tighter than asian eyes 
 get realize we just stay than around the city with nowhere to go

 damn yeezy man, made something from nothing 
 they don't wanna hear the speech 
 yeah i mumble while
