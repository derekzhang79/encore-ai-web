 we'll even been so led on 
 i've been runnin' 'round 
 i feel like christmas officially 
 told her that you came all over the movie 
 i think i'm too passive 
 til i pull out the chopper, start blastin' 
 i know he had a belt you should be talking to a beat and you know them people too convinced that my money's doin' in the world lost in the world 
 to the world, to the world 
 now let's take 'em high-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh la la la now 
 want some r&b 
 only god man 
 all for the future like hell is given you won’t slide across that stage 
 a muthafucka can’t pull you across that stage 
 a muthafucka can’t pull you up maña-naaaaaaaaaa! 
 
 her money, money baby, ooh baby 
 you know i need that reptile 
 they won't never take that from me 
 my reign is in bed an high 
 and live my life 
 just to get off and throw my hands up high 
 
 [kanye west - verse 1] 
 may the beat noah…
