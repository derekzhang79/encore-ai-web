 just to be like he's brand new 
 
 [chorus - elly jackson:] 
 i've been workin' this graveshift and i ain't made everything i was born 
 i'm like a drug overlord, my jewelry's overboard 
 i’m nice now 
 when i shop they think their words affect me is too stupid 
 and i been runnin' from the king 
 yeah, after that then the cut my face lit up in me 
 i'm on that back to the point, i got the thing to mars 
 
 now we gon’ take it to the moon, take it to the moon, take it to the moon, take it to the light 
 and then my bitches extra thick sonic boom! 
 don't say you will, one day you will 
 i pray you will 
 
 mrs. so-fly crash-lands in my room 
 can't waste no time, she might leave with me, how it comes to my sound which is the champion sound (swerve) 
 believe! believe! (swerve) 
 
 [chris brown:] 
 fake shit to god to the light
