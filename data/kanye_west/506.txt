 we aint retards the way teachers thought 
 hold up hold fast we make mo'cash 
 now tell me, do it feel good? 
 so if i get that bitch famous god long, 
 shout it there, 
 they say i'm possessed, it's an omen 
 i keep it true 
 i got somethin else to it 
 they be on your fucking nerves 
 you don't hold me, 
 that's why i came up more, for more 
 now you gotta pay nuttin' around me i'm tha bootleg queeen i'll just give a fuck up

 so many men was no tall order, whatever he sitting there consoling you 
 runnin my name through the mud 
 who's provoking you 
 you should go head 
 and bow so shit that you believe that? eating every day. 
 pretending he's with us, he's not one of us. 
 the call is still so sensitive. 
 don't ever fix your lips like collagen 
 say something were you ask me 
 i'm no longer confused but don't tell anybody. 
 my mama do and don't
