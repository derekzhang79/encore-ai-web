 just can't live with us 
 i’m winning again, i’m at the wynn 
 i'm going to learn too. 
 i'm going to get you 
 to put the plane now 
 its bad enough i 
 can i know if you go for school, 
 and i was about to be number one? 
 this is the story of a champion 
 rounders in the mob and they pop the chains 
 told you got to call me, i trying to get free 
 you the type of girl i swear you was a motherfucking waiter there 
 
 [pusha t:] 
 24/7, 365, pussy stays on my mind 
 doing things my way, dawg 
 plus my real friends 
 if we were cemented 
 what if we fuck right now? 
 what if we just tryin to feel invisible 
 see i still got time to grow 
 things ain't always set in stone 
 that be known of sierra leone 
 and now we just resent it 
 the clouds is in my vision 
 pour out my feelings 
 and the day
