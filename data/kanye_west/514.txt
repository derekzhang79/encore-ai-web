 i ain’t don't wanna play me again 
 cause i only be god except i added more o’s 
 if i should call her ma'am 
 i love all these things these things 
 [males:] all these things (oooh) all these long-ass verses 
 no lie 
 no lie 
 ooh baby, ooh baby 
 you set the night on fire 
 i'm a new shit with that heaven do 
 send us an angel, so i see you 
 good music, we fresh, we fresh 
 anything else, we detest, detest 
 bitch-ass niggas got ass and breasts 
 all that said, let me ask you 
 how will i ever love again 
 goodbye my friend will i ever love again 
 goodbye my friend will i ever love again 
 
 never stop, that's the way i entertain 
 
 we invested in that it's back to business 
 you need to real kanye 
 cause we all down 
 we gon’ stop me huh? 
 
 [chorus:] 
 i got the world
