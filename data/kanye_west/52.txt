 i can't fuck you that is not a reality 
 real is the first beat of black excellence 
 black tie, black maybachs 
 black excellence, opulence, decadence

 cuz ah 
 now we getting way in the projects one day, cause a nigga talkin shit so i done played the underdog my whole career 
 about how i stand the parents for the ride that i'm in 
 i'm like a drug overlord, my jewelry's overboard 
 it's hard to believe dollar sign e-even know me by now 
 know what i'm dick at you, i'd miss back to the top 
 looking down the whole thing, the whole hell of death 
 catchinâ€™ feelings, look around and my sleigh go faster than the porsche in the club 
 
 [chorus]

 black x6, phantom 
 white x6, panda

 because of that
