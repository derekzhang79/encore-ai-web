 the hood got common haters 
 in some relations, you just supposed to life baby 
 gotta call ferris up 
 (swerve) 
 
 [kanye west & swizz beatz:] 
 for all my southside niggas like horizon's coast 
 do i ask you i fight one red and was in a safe again 
 
 [kanye west talking] 
 shake that body, party that body 
 come on homie what life is really worth 
 no to x but haters turn around, real feelings might surface 
 been a nice guy 
 or do anal, or do a gangbang 
 they cut from a tribe in? 
 fake friends and get it 
 you wanna fuck with us 
 bam bam 
 you aint rude away than me 
 i want it right now 
 all of my kindness 
 is taken for weakness 
 
 [hook - kanye west] 
 girl my real friends? 
 just 'bout to fuck with this girl 
 now that gucci's home, high joints like this 
 pure bliss, pure bliss 
 nobody canâ€™t get you first 
 but why i got to bone 
 stay out the building in a world gone
