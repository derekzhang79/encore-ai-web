 bally’s on my feet go 
 what if mary was in the club 
 she knows that my bitch 
 
 [chorus - kanye west] 
 man i told you to say one day you'll just know 
 that you know 
 what going to leave them to say i ain't nobody perfect 
 and now i look and look around and there's so many kanyes 
 i used to love to 
 so close, but so i’ma set the scramblers 
 this is everything 
 everything thing, a world 
 i'm a king with a couple of flaws 
 sometimes i feel the music 'til i'm in polo's smilin they take shit up 
 none of you all was broke 
 'member we ain't have to be a way 
 and nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way 
 
 cuz you loves of god 
 
 [chorus kanye west)] 
 
 [verse 1] 
 didn't you know how i finally got through 
 you lose, you lose 
 you lose, you lose 
 you lose, you lose 
 you lose, you lose 
 you getting blackmailed for that
