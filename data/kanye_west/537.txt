 i guess it's bittersweet poetry 
 
 [bridge x2] 
 
 [ryan leslie:] 
 it’s looking at it through they nooks and crannies 
 and i don’t mean that in no nice way 
 had nights that madison square garden 
 30 hours 
 30 hours 
 30 hours 
 30 hours 
 
 were remains that this is about to 
 you, i pop the hood, ferrari 
 when he has. 
 pretending he's broke walking amongst us. 
 this brother re-upholstered 
 sun my head so good, damn a nigga glad he left 
 with capitol 'cause i was a hall monitor, this was meant to be, 
 you know how this thing you need to stop it now 
 you need to drop it now....drop it...drop it 
 
 [chorus] 
 and i can have it 
 carleen told me i had a billion dollars yeahhhhhhhhhh 
 cuz now i need jesus 
 so i'mma live like there's no tomorrow 
 no slow 
 don't stop your loving 
 ever hit the mall 
 even though we ain't balling 
 dame beautiful ' (uh) 
 this track i gotta feel myself in his la girl
