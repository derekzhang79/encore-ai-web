 i'm comin in when i feel like 
 to the night about to go down 
 
 [chorus - kanye west] 
 man i know that people wouldn't usually rap this 
 i appreciate what you allowed for me 
 
 diamonds are forever forever, forever, shit 
 you just trying to find where to raise my phone and don't kill a good years 
 my chain too heavy 
 all the street lights, glowin 
 happen to be just like moments, passin 
 in front of me 
 i'm trippin', i'm caught up in the moment 
 i got here in the club like this again 
 bougie i'll be dead or not 
 people play me 
 even if his mama tweakin’ 
 cause my chain commands, that kind of respect 
 and its intensity 
 it's funny i ain't spoke to so young 
 they mad they're still nameless talk that talk, man 
 south, south, south side! all day, nigga 
 swish, swish, how long they motherfucker in the kitchen with the heat making beats in chicago 
 mercy, mercy me, how niggas rewardin’
