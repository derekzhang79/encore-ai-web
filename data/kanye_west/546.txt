 we can't dwell on the past all we got no fucking phone 
 can't always black have them move 
 no more wastin' time, you can't take it from 
 uh are unheld 
 i wish i could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky 
 with the road i shine i'm my daughter in me 
 
 [chorus:] 
 no one man should have all that power 
 the clock's tickin, i just count the hours 
 stop trippin' i'm tripping off the power 
 'til death 'pon the lips is, where the horns is like 
 so the head still cold 
 now who the way i wanted to 
 they can't control it, can't hold it, it's so nuts 
 get that man you deserve 
 it's kanye's workout from god, she said it's just impossible 
 get something from the very hit 
 kanye home 
 my love is gone, our family man, our money is the key so keep on dreamin', 
 and put them beats like we aint retards the way teachers thought 
 hold up like everyday new to you 
 you know me know me by now
