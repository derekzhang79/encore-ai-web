 
 when you real bad news 
 
 [bridge] 
 we flyer than a parakeet, floatin' with no parachute 
 six thousand dollar pair of shoes, i made it to the paris news 
 don't talk about style cause i embarrass you 
 shut the fuck up when you talk to me 
 hello 'mari, how ya doin'? 
 it may be the only way 
 
 [beat changes] 
 
 [pusha t:] 
 5 star dishes, different exotic fishes 
 man this motherfucker is the exact motherfucker i look at my face, do i got a promise face? 
 does it look like promise you always blame me 
 love me 
 i know i stayed on my grind, 
 its worse, that's why you always see me with the king in my mouth drive like baby 
 you never thought i was scary to see 
 i said i never rock a mink coat 
 i just wanna design hotels and nail it 
 shit off 
 lasting longer than the g fight i came by 
 that came from sri lanka 
 yeah iâ€™m high to the very far away place
