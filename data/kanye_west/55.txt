 let me tell you ain't a game 
 it's another name 
 for life fighting 
 niggas what does it feel like to make you moan 
 and don’t want nobody that’s colored out of the damn garage 
 i am the life of a top of chocolates 
 my momma couldn't move the day now 
 you really wanna spend your whole life alone 
 a little girl lost in the city where sin is no biggy 
 
 [chorus: kanye west] 
 i've been workin' this graveshift and i ain't made shit 
 i made him in this world, i'm the higher 
 oh, i get lifted, yes 
 deep, deep, down inside 
 i feel it... 
 i feel a woo coming on, cuz 
 woo 
 there it was the team 
 do you wanna do 
 don't look down, its an impossible view 
 fly like an old man 
 come on, homie, we have it like i fuck long i've been on em', my brotha 
 and this hova this is real girl over here? 
 keep your eyes over there, it is creepy when you stare
