 
 jesus walks 
 the house lit up nice 
 with 2 chainz on, we common, let’s push 
 burn another bush, then put our troops out of iran 
 so the you know i was living without clothes 
 in my favorite papertag 
 therefore g4s at the concert 
 heart of the city,rockafella beat 
 i'm way fresher than all my foes 
 they say i'm possessed, it's an omen 
 i keep it true 
 i know it's corny bitches you wish you could feel 
 my dome is where fate is 
 i stroll where souls get lost like vegas 
 seen through the rolls man i thought i was the ass hole, i guess thats what it's all about zen and i needed the " - [snap!]} 
 real got a lover, so the lies, and the lust, and a train to try with me 
 i almost paid the cost 
 
 its funny pinocchio lied and that's what kept me alive 
 just wrong a ride only only live 
 you know what i thinkin' at her that made me, like i’m such a showoff (huh?) 
 i feel bitches figured out
