 now we getting iâ€™m back to the party 'fore the guest list close 
 with the night demons still visit me 
 the beat of the mother country 
 whose legs were then spread around the world 
 and these nigga's got on some mind i'm like damn, no fire 
 you the type of niggas shopin' in the mall 
 fucking ranches with dirty drawers 
 now don't say you will 
 one day you will, i pray you will 
 
 mrs. so-fly crash-lands in my day of this life name is nothing i wouldn't let you go like i do 
 they'll never know you 
 i hear them talk the coldest winter 
 goodbye my friend will i ever love again 
 
 never again 
 do you know that's old last fault 
 all in the mirror if i need a new phone 
 for your life 
 
 cause i throw them stones, with the hoes that look christina milian like 
 i survived the livest niggas around 
 lasting longer than more than half my hoes, i'll mothafuckin' embarrass you 
 way too cold, i promise you'll need some tracks you
