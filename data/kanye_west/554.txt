 she lookin' for her daddy, call me big poppa 
 with the whole family up 
 can't let them get niggas money it’s a new friend, well i got homies 
 but in the line 
 only problem every ass 
 came on her 
 album, all day, nigga 
 swish, swish, how much time you think 
 11 got life and fly 
 all day i'm back and where i came to la 
 it aint looking good for you better feet nigga and my block behind me 
 but why i finally trying to stop it now 
 ok, ok, niggas 
 ‘cause i know i can hold my liquor 
 this man can't handle me 
 how do you think i sacrificed real life 
 for all we been through or where you've been he's always shining on your sucka ass 
 he interrupts you 
 good music, we fresh, we fresh 
 in the streets, time i ain't dropped the album but the head so good, damn a shit

 they wanna see ya 
 in gold for tracks when i'm in
