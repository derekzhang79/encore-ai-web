 my hot a god 
 running outta work, hey 
 
 my face turnt to stone 
 when i see it 
 riding down the 405, baby 
 pacing, thinking, to myself right now 
 you is out of my mind 
 primetime, never had it like this 
 give head, stop breathe, get up, check your weave 
 don't drop the blunt and disrespect the benz hole 
 and we got his show 
 how do we love with it 
 why you actin' all 
 shy and all about that benz marina del rey coastin' 
 she in school bein around 
 we be so cold for the day 
 
 hey, hey, hey, hey 
 please say you will, one day you will, i pray you will 
 
 hey, hey, hey, hey 
 got a crush on me like i was almost 
 i'd be worried if they got their friends 
 i pulled up with the guap 
 park the death house 
 i donâ€™t even know what i ride for 
 be a nice try 
 you know i tell them next to it's your shit 
 i dropped up
