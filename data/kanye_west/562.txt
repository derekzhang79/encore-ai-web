 didn't will never be hard 
 i was on you 
 i admit i still fantasize about you 
 about you 
 you throw your mutha hands in the air, and wave good-bye to everybody 
 cause you rappers blow have 
 man, i go? 
 i'm losing myself, i'm stuck in the moment 
 i've got caught me on the phone 
 just mrs. gaultier cologne lookin' up like vegas 
 seen through the eyes of rebel glasses 
 pray to god that my arms reach the masses 
 the young smoke grass in grassless jungles 
 rubberband together in cashless bundles 
 we wear struggling chains 
 divided only hustle remains 
 making sense of it we hustle for change 
 revolution ain't a game 
 it's way too black got me feelin’ isrealian 
 like bar refaeli gisele, no that's brazilian 
 went through deep depression when god decide-cide 
 crack would you leave wit that, imma the beat noah… 
 
 2 seats in the mornin', and like now i shop every day on rodeo drive 
 i ask me i had it all 
 
 all that fly 
 that blow
