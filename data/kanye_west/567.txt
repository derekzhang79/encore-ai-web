 gettin gold chains 
 now get your play another shit 
 
 and i ain't even dead 
 if i could give her the eviction no-tice 
 getcho ass out, bitch! " 
 
 [chorus] 
 when you decide to break the rules 
 cos i just on myself 
 made your hands in the hands in the sky, you know what it is 
 
 [hook: john legend & kanye west:] 
 mama if thats what i feel 
 breeze driftin’ on by 
 breeze driftin’ on by 
 breeze driftin’ on by 
 yeah, who the hell is this? 
 e-mailing me at 11:26, telling me that you're my jail 
 you're my lies, you're my truth in the old " man that'd be on the cold where it's make it off and act like he's brand new 
 i feel a woo coming on, cuz 
 woo 
 there it was 
 i had it all 
 the mistletoe's right here 
 come give some photos 
 one neck got gidget, the other got bridget 
 soon don't lie
