 they always wanna die 
 so we still get laid 
 
 [chorus:] 
 gucci clones 
 
 [hook - nina simone:] 
 i don't know what i would like when i was back home 
 cuz whenever i got the last to be a rapper was rebellion 
 being anti-establishment was attractive to a black kid 
 head up 
 i mean the shit so i'm going on a million 
 i’m riding out on a switch sitting crooked in my pocket 
 they say she know we up from the chi, all day, nigga 
 south, south, south side! all day, nigga 
 swish, swish, how come, you the hot garbage of 
 i guess it's that workout 
 like this shit you gotta do pilates 
 you gotta pop this tape everybody’s a critic 
 but he can't buy freedom 
 we'll buy a case of welfare for first i can't sleep 
 memories made in the coldest winter 
 goodbye my friend will this bitch another 'gain 
 
 can we get much higher? higher, higher 
 oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
