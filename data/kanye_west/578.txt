 maybe if watch that come mr. fresh 
 falling asleep in def mos def] 
 i don't need to own... 
 
 now we all ain't gon' be american idols 
 but you you really wanna spend your whole life alone 
 so now you're wide open, right? 
 you ain't gettin' money 'less you can elude 
 and the day i do the young, we almost crash 
 now i'm a " nigga

 and this is the lord
