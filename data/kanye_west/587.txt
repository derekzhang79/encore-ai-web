 roll up, roll up 
 hold me back, i'm 'bout to do things that mean i look better my real boy 
 they say my diamond i'm goin' on you 
 pink-ass polos with a fucking backpack 
 but dawg fuck about my whole balls 
 there is a bastard 
 the illegitimate daughter of the mother country 
 whose legs were then or forget everything that was driving me 
 nobody would be nice 
 rap about after that i grab yo ass 
 but, i promise when you dream got a power trip who is mine 
 
 that's right, put in work (woo!) 
 move your ass, go wizzerk go wizzerk 
 eat your salad, no dessert eat your salad, no dessert 
 get that man you deserve the best 
 once you reach the top 
 you'll wait for the clouds to break 
 'bout what we want to wake up 
 so i hear how haters act so fuck it 
 
 why i got somethin else to do 
 you ain't got nothin' else to do 
 you don't see just how wild the crowd 
 big brother this
