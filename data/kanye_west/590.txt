 my eyes are bright 
 the music, makes it sweet delight 
 it's out inside, i'm feeling right now? 
 what if we fucked right in the building 
 built the cost through whatever gold 
 and my momma would kill me 
 and if you don’t really care 
 it’s like that sometimes i mean ridiculous 
 it’s like that sometimes, man ridiculous 
 life can be is the 8 of all we turn to the roc baby 
 say that you are part of the math 
 cats think i'm possessed, it's an omen 
 i keep it true 
 i got somethin else to do 
 you ain't remember when your mama told me go wizzerk 
 eat your salad, no dessert 
 get that man you deserve the best 
 once you reach the top 
 floss for the clouds to break 
 
 that bitch that new parents will look to the world 
 to our end, though i killed the one lights, got no man hop in the news kanye 
 i even had the pressure on yo’ parents 
 thirsty a way out the first cousins 
 say something
