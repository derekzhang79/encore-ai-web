 i done wore designers i won't hit a strip club and i played 'heart of the city.' 
 and beans was all up the blunt and disrespect the shit 
 i know it's corny bitches you wish you could give it all up, but it's not the way of thinking, nigga never be signed

 they say you're living like you died before 
 i got a place that only i can go 
 oooh let me take you for a minute?

 breeze driftin’ on by 
 breeze driftin’ on by, you know how i feel running round i be on me 
 and i ain't even pledge 
 crack my whole life
