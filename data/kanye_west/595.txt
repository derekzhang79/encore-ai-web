 kept caught through the wall 
 you know i love to show off 
 i asked the nurse did you realize 
 why i use two lifelines 
 in the game took yo’ life our new life for me 
 for a chick that say yes to soon 
 until you have a daughter, that's what the fuck we doin'? 
 
 oh ya, fly you more 
 
 [chorus - elly jackson:] 
 i've been down this road, too many bitches came in twos 
 and they both suck like they came to lose 
 dropped out the first to blow up? 
 get they love and still be underpaid 
 got staples on my dick " than christmas in my mind 
 doing things i suggest 
 them old no way 
 fuck 'em ye up there we run, oh 
 
 [verse 2] 
 what you want a bentley, fur coat and diamond chain? 
 all my niggas is thirsty and it wasn't any kanyes 
 and to attone i throw a little somethin, 'em at least a word 
 cause we were pictures 
 she couldn’t hit the liquor
