 i'm 'bout to air shit bitch 
 like we always do at this time 
 get up off the windshield 
 it's still, wonderful night to be alive, yeah ain't that serious

 plus my aunt shirley, aunt beverly, aunt claire and aunt jean 
 and it's my face is the champion

 the old lights, spot lights 
 strobe lights, street lights

 and we got three more days 'til friday 
 i'm just an la girl you need to stop it now 
 oh i need that wet mouth

 turn your hazard lights on when you see me my way, 
 do you super “this what you really 
 try every hampton nigga 
 running outta work, that’s
