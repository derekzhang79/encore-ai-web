 [charlie wilson chorus] 
 i know you love my new bitch and it's all because of you the " 
 somebody last real friends? 
 all white bitches when you growing up worthless 
 middle finger in the air if you play crazy you ain't signed? 
 wasn't caught in the rain 
 or rocking flannels all summer said 
 in the low 
 gave you bobby brown jaw 
 close my soul 
 or that dolce gabbana with a few toys like a happy shit 
 my nephew gone, my heart is torn 
 sometimes i look to the world, i made up in the spot 
 this is everything 
 but i never thought that you would take it this far 
 what do i know? flashing lights, lights 
 what do you know? flashing lights, lights 
 cause i used to laugh 
 who lasts? yeah, you lie
