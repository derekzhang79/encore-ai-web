 we all pray 
 i want it right now 
 all of the lines 
 so i’m late as a nigga don’t preach you n-gga 
 don't stare like let me get my team in 
 
 [chorus] 
 no matter what you've been through 
 they love kanye, i used to love when i'm in need 
 i don't need to stop it now 
 oh you just gonna 
 keep it like you never said 
 you gon' lie 
 we be on fire 
 they said baby you type cleans 
 aw hell no! 
 
 i arrived on long i've about to let me know where i love 
 and when i be listening to jodeci 
 and when i call you back 
 i hear them talk the coldest winter 
 
 can we get our grind man 
 but we can't listen baby 
 they've never had it like this 
 they say i'm possessed, it's an omen 
 i keep it 300, like the romans 
 300 bitches, where's the trojans? 
 they about that they use two lifelines 
 
 back one time? 
 niggas fantasize about the benjamins 
 big
