 [girl #3] 
 my nigga went to jail, yo, 
 do you think about me now and then? 
 do you think about me now and then? 
 do you think i sacrificed real life 
 this ain't no money that was slaughtered in the hood, the new world order 
 meanwhile the dea 
 teamed up with the mission 
 did the fashion show, and a tour, and a movie, and a score 
 this little light of mine to be inside a graveyard 
 move downtown, cop it. 
 broke phi broke 
 we ain't got it 
 broke, broke, broke phi broke 
 we ain't got it 
 [louder] 
 broke, broke broke phi broke 
 we ain't got it 
 no, we have no money 
 we got no clothes 
 ain't got no cars 
 ain't got no hos 
 we broke, broke, broke phi broke 
 we ain't got it 
 broke, broke, broke phi broke 
 we ain't got it 
 feel like when did you lying 
 momma pass in hollywood 
 if you ask,
