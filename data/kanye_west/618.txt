 in the studio, to work straight up! 
 we gon’ make it to ballots to choose leadership 
 but this bastard's flow will bash a skull 
 and i just want you to see everything 
 want you to see you again! 
 i was gonna pop by rich 
 i've even the most high 
 but i ain't finished, i'm devoted 
 and you know a nigga rep that westside (westside!) 
 westside, westside! 
 so te-te-tell who the freshest of 'em all? 
 they claimin' that they should be here in the morning 
 no lie 
 ooh baby, ooh baby 
 you set the night on fire 
 i'm always blamin' you, welcome to you, it's young ladies then still got messed up 
 how we tried to say nothing 
 everybody gon' say you will, one day you will, i pray you will 
 
 mrs. so-fly crash-lands in my room 
 can't waste no time, she might leave soon 
 and i drove on the other side 
 gotta keep my face to show this shit, can't stop me? 
 who gon’ stop me? 
 who gon’ stop me huh?
