 30 minutes later seems there's no convincing them 
 'til we go 
 now, we ain’t longer wear her back 
 keep it up enough to make it this far 
 so many scars 
 ‘bout to take this whole thing to mars 
 
 now we gon’ take it to the moon, take it to the moon, take it to the young 
 maybe you can rap about me, tell nori about me 
 tell nori about me, tell nori about me 
 tell nori about me, tell nori about me 
 tell nori about me, i'm a bastard 
 the illegitimate daughter of the mother country 
 sweet queen betty 
 sweet jesus 
 we made it in america 
 
 [verse 2: jay-z]

 roll up the doge, henny and c-c-c-cola, then i'm co coming over 
 cuz its ne-never over 
 
 [chorus]
