 its a remix 
 he was that shit that make bitches act out of spite, aiight 
 oh momma, i guess it also depends tho, if jay got this, preach 
 rain, rain, rain go away 
 we made it from the alley straight up to ballet 
 we see it right now

 you sold on the pulpit. 
 we never been so high kiss the ground goodbye 
 and i don't know about me and you 
 so why send depression not blessings? i can do it

 if young metro don't trust you i'm gon' shoot you

 beautiful morning, you're the sun in my life 
 “when you coming home” that’s a text from or fake shit 
 and now you be my chain 
 lost in translation with a whole fuckin' nation

 who was hip hop brother 
 on that independent shit
