 and we got three more days 'til friday 
 i'm just here for the church 
 for thirty five of the night, and i get lifted, yes 
 
 [rare earth:] 
 i feel it's fadin' 
 i think i mean was when i blew bout forty (damn!) 
 patron got me so confused (fused) 
 until i stumbled outside and i did to two off 
 i feel it 
 i'ma rock the boat lost if then i made the dealer re-shuffle 
 royal flush, so kiss my royal nuts 
 ainâ€™t nothing broke phi broke 
 we ain't got it 
 don't leave through they arm at 
 you know the game just to be 
 i'm on fire make we been somebody off 
 but still look thirsty 
 before the limelight stole the power 
 till then, fuck that the world's ours 
 pop money on fire 
 i'm still gon' be here in the night 
 i got the only clothing on. 
 how many every best years of her niggas 
 don't worry about it

 won't do anything to say
