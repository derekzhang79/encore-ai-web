 heard they'd get my advance out 
 life is precious 
 we found out, we found out 
 we found out 
 we found out 
 we found out 
 we found out 
 we found out 
 we found out 
 we found out 
 we found out 
 we found out 
 we found out 
 if ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out 
 push a new religion 
 no sins 
 but we can't listen baby 
 they've never had nothing handed took nothing 
 they wanna ghostface wanna be me 
 i'm going to hit a young nigga get money any more? 
 tell peta my mink is dragging on the floor 
 that's my way did i got to leave 
 we make it out alive 
 all right, all right 
 ugh, wavey, baby, yeah 
 yeah me 
 baby drop another slow jam 
 and all a fuckin' debauchery 
 adult film star, somebody's fuckin' watchin' me 
 i love it though 
 
 [chorus - rihanna:] 
 i know i lot of god i can feel it 
 i'ma rock the boat 
 work the middle 'til it
