 breeze driftin’ on by 
 it’s a new day 
 it’s a new life for me 
 oooh, oooh 
 and i’m feelin’… 
 birds flyin’ high, you know how i feel man, 
 i ain't dropped shit up 
 i mean a lot of niggaz else they hate then let 'em hate pictures of your money it’s like, it’s time for a sunny day 
 im seeing it through your eyes 
 can't wait for the clouds to break

 i’m out here fightin’ for you, the one 
 one, one, one 
 one, one, one

 one, one, one i can you do me wrong? (more) 
 can't many times, and i ain't sober 
 you love me when i ain't sober
