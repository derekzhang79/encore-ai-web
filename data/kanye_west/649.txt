 i decided we weren't gonna speak and you would take it this far 
 what do you know? flashing lights, lights 
 cause i be with us, it's cool out 
 life is precious 
 we ain't married but tonight i put monie in the middle 
 niggas tryna like a nigga 
 and i don’t know why i keep that bull smart 
 more than ever, hour after, 
 our work is never over.
