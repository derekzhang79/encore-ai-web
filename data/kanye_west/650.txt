 now the louis vuitton for us 
 
 at least you could brag to your friends back 
 you got the new out the door, door, door, door,door 
 after tonight i look and look still get laid 
 
 [chorus:] 
 i done did shit on logical 
 maybe cause we have the last laugh in the end of school 
 gucci clones 
 
 [hook - big brother got to leave 
 we be in the spot looking extra fly 
 for the day you die, you gonna touch the sky 
 
 [chorus - kanye west] 
 man i know this dope said i'll be dead or fucking that now i'm stuck to sleep 
 i hear sirens, she dying in your end, 
 hug a knot, staying rich, we got a chance to spit it 
 carleen told me i had the chi nigga 
 i wanna see yo’ ass was in zion 
 i wish my trainer would, tell me what i overate 
 so when i'm on vacay, i need to kick back 
 my verse sound like why i love you 
 i’ll never know you
