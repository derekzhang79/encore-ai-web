 [pusha t:] 
 as 'ye flips the piano 
 the mood swings like the song 
 for santa claus, so bake a turkey, burn a few logs 
 i just start in where i already knew 
 
 while im lights, things 
 iâ€™m about to have mine 
 and when they get bubbly 
 at nyu but them cars is wack 
 if you don't even have to write rhymes 
 the dynasty thing 
 all these fancy things 
 i got my liberty, chopping grams up 
 street justice, you rap for? haaan? 
 aw man, gotta leave it wrong 
 cause i don't need a new bitch 
 but we the elite 
 we the new jacksons, i'm all inside 
 i get lifted, yes 
 deep, deep, down inside 
 i feel a woo coming on, cuz 
 woo 
 there it was 
 i feel like i would like to work things factually 
 had be a minutes later in a fresh pair of nikes 
 niggaz give me fifty million her and track the indian dance to bring our reign back 
 the house lit
