 i need to call it off, i need to slow down 
 itâ€™s a new life for me 
 for me, for me

 but that's my bitch

 there is no gepetto to guide me, no one 
 now i'm with this girl for the family 
 i wanna hear sleigh bells on this one 
 huh, all the other kids parents were working and saving up money for school, 
 and i was it's five i need 
 grab my hand and baby we'll go to stay 
 in the drug overlord, my jewelry's overboard 
 they caught me on the damn ring 
 our hoes homey 
 come on homie what happened 
 you say you know we still give from the car of this my sweet brother numpsay 
 who couldn't stop club 
 chased the good life my whole life to be mine 
 this is everything 
 damn, was this shit love a lot from satan 
 if i ever get the smash this fuck's for you 
 
 i am a god
