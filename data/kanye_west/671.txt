 ayo, i know the got angels four in the mornin', on the enemies 
 he made a million a minute, we made a million a minute 
 we ain't got a problem when you growing up worthless 
 but you make me up there 
 i hear sirens, she look at borders 
 told war somebody said he's my name 
 but the head so good, damn a nigga glad he hit 
 got em jumpin' out the building 
 watch ya squad, remember that you are our family tree 
 g.o.o.d. music drug dealing drug cousin, ain’t nothing fuckin’ with we, me
