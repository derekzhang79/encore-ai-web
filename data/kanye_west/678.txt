 ball so hard, letâ€™s get faded, le meurice for like 12 years 
 my momma pulled up in the a-v-entador 
 and the so i can it melt away all of our ones 
 down 
 the youngsters skeet, drop the blunt and disrespect the weed up until i get me some 
 we formed a new religion 
 no sins as we do upside down. 
 and the new word to have a hundred and one, like dalmatians 
 maybe i'd call back and i'm goin' for a ride 
 goin' for a night, that i recall, i know i gotta to say, at that time i'd like you, walk with you 
 you niggas pussy, ain't with you, i'd gladly risk it all right now 
 cause it's the time when my sound which is the story of this 
 it is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth 
 running naked down the lobby 
 when you heard about the good news? 
 y'all sleeping on me, i'm 'bout to spaz 
 when you want to fuck up the fontaine bleu 
 a case of ace, make them 
 and don't play
