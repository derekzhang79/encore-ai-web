 
 [verse the vernon and round they up with the team 
 good music 
 they fire of a real mc to the most player 
 and these guys are out here making 
 money all i got to work 
 high and lose your hands 
 
 bitches got a pistol on my hip 
 and it's back to business 
 you wanna give it through the wire, even through the fire 
 i got my own jr. on the way, and the shit back to rich 
 no one man should have all that power 
 the clock's tickin, i just count the hours 
 stop trippin' i'm tripping off the power 
 till then, 
 i'll fly away. 
 
 just a few more weary days 'til friday 
 i'm a fly nigga in miami wearing winter clothes 
 i got what you need 
 wassup, wassup, wassup, wassup 
 
 [jay-z kanye west)] 
 who else you called 'bout a thousand times with was your mouth 
 bound 
 
 [hook:] 
 bound to fall in love uh-huh, honey
