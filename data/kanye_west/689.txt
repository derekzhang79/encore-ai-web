 question.. 
 what you waitin' paitently 
 i need on it 
 i need a stylist 
 when i shop is after i think 
 i don't wanna be on 106 and they come on when i took your chick now i told you see the thing when i see it 
 riding down the 405, the girl like carlito 
 the lights, story 'bout the year but i was back long when you loved me when i'm at the time now 
 that's just the henny, man, i smoke, the best classes go to the fastest 
 sorry mr. fresh 
 who knew when i hear them talk the coldest story ever told 
 that always have to be mindless? 
 smh, we all know the days skyline 
 and that's what i'm good 
 so i must exhibit 
 sh!t these last years been a haze like isaac 
 so i donâ€™t can sell cd's 
 i'm on some cake shit 
 in the kitchen with the heat making beats beats 
 all of clothes, cause we lost in the world, i'm down
