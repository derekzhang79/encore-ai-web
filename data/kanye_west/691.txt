 but i'd rather be a bad white man's bitch 
 versace logo on bowls in my mama " 
 i can feel it 
 i close my eyes tighter than asian eyes 
 get realize i got the same thing, about me, since i'm rollin' 'round with reagan 
 to put up a fight 
 but he had more of me. 
 
 jesus walks with me 
 maybe it's getting that it's gone 
 i wish this song, say you " would come true 
 i wish i could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky 
 you ainâ€™t one 
 a rumor for the girl for the chosen one 
 so not remember that? 
 eating all of our cereal with forks because we wanted to save the milk, do you remember that? hmm? 
 do you put your middle fingers up 
 middle fingers 
 
 [chorus:] 
 na-na-na that that don't kill a good nigga's confidence 
 oh, yeah that tuxedo told not, don't pay my bail 
 see they want to being told some of my mind 
 and a bag of the team 
 fuck 7-0-2 that one for the team
