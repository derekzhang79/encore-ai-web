 cause this shit bout to go down 
 
 [kanye west:] 
 picked you out now, i know you see me now right now, right now 
 i need that happy beginnin', middle and endin' 
 chicago, st. louis, st. louis nigga, ric flair nigga 
 the powerâ€™s in my raw oats 
 in the penthouse position for some action 
 but if you ever wanted to be was soldiers 
 so the new told to let you know 
 
 [verse 5: cyhi da prynce] 
 i hope the whole block'd hear me a hundred million no compromise 
 i'm a rap-lic priest 
 getting head by the fussing and fighting 
 tell them other as we die from drugs 
 over there, i go to sleep at night you n-gga 
 don't make the rules 
 even though i went along up with the molly 
 and put them lottery tickets just to keep on the tv up 
 looking at every ass 
 cheated on every test 
 i never fuck a bitch 
 as our spirits fly into the never end 
 the one chief rocka, number one chief
