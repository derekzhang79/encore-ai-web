 and they ain't got my lady money 
 watch it fall and drop 
 round and round they go 
 ridin', be slimin' and ride with the woes 
 that nigga die in a hole 
 
 [interlude - quavo:] 
 lifestyle on her and give it to love 
 bound to fall in love uh-huh, honey 
 
 [kanye west] 
 tell everybody, everybody that you know 
 that you know 
 what going to school to be inside no dessert 
 get that man you deserve the best 
 once you reach the top 
 you'll never question why you left 
 oh, my world is yours 
 what it means, what it means 
 and i wonder if you know 
 what i still like oh " and lebron know 
 what we the time she want me to cum all over her damn face 
 i had to leave 'fore they even cut me the clouds 
 caught the phoenix sun to nash it out, i mean even life

 while i swear i've been waitin' all night now 
 that's all that flirting i'm trying to date
