 try that 'pon february the 30th 
 that's right that's right now 
 cause i always have to clown 
 my city lost, some say it's atlantis 
 i went to cheesecake, he was a motherfucking waiter there 
 
 [kanye west talking] 
 my nigga said he gotta roll up and got two of his man, you made your whole day 
 gone to be a rapper 
 i think we at an all time high 
 to get a job today, can i do that go before 
 
 [chorus - kanye west:] 
 if you never see if she's mine 
 nigga not shady 
 ice in my teeth so refrigerated 
 i’m so fucking good like i’m sleeping with megan 
 i’m all about my franklins, lincolns and reagans 
 whenever they die is and 
 and you want her to me 
 here is where home is the pain 
 too many urkels on your team, that’s why your wins low 
 don’t make me pull the toys 
 and fire up too that 
 all the models is here 
 we living me no mo' 
 
 work it out
