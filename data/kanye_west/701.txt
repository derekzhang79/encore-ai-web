 but i ain't even dead 
 if i pulled up to the light 
 and then my bitch came home 
 high 
 
 [kanye west - verse 1] 
 didn't you know can take it this far? 
 i’m supercharged 
 i’m cause time, my watch pictures when my dad was in school. 
 he was so gready with degrees, he took my degree. 
 and now i'm just on my waist turn beef to patties 
 and if we run trains, we all in the same gang 
 runaway slaves all on a chain gang 
 bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang uh like an uncle that touched you 
 the paper read murder, black on black murder again 
 black on black murder again 
 black on black murder again 
 
 leave that bitch in the world lost in the world 
 as long as i'm killed on that candy-lac 
 life while watch hands 
 and if you fail me, let me hear you say ahhhh 
 va-va-va-va-va-va
