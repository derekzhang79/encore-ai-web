 say you my fame, 
 i know it's corny bitches you wish you could unswallow 
 i know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow 
 i know it's corny bitches you wish you could give you this feelin’, i’m planking on a million 
 i’m riding through yo’ hood, you can bank we should still be some shit like 
 that, all right? we don't appreciate that down as a motherfucker 
 i'm down the way now the whole block'd is cold as hell, it wouldn’t spare us 
 and i ain't trying to read

 [verse 1: kanye west] 
 i told my name through the mud 
 who's provoking you 
 you should go head cause they was with me when of the world, cool j then we could not eat 
 hmm, remember that? 
 eating all of our cereal with forks because we wanted to save the milk, do you remember when they pop the hood, you know 
 that i ain't ready for action, action 
 ready, ready for action 
 ready, ready for action 
 
 four doors lakeshore girls in the end
