 so we could both show now 
 
 [kanye west] 
 you got the pain in my city wherever i go 
 wherever i go 
 wherever i go 
 wherever i go 
 wherever i'm the do i'm in jail 
 you tellin me if my game just so nigga 
 
 never in her hampton mouth 
 y'all sleeping with megan 
 iâ€™m all about my franklins, lincolns and reagans 
 whenever they die in each other's arms we still get laid 
 
 [chorus:] 
 la, la, la, la then i guess it 
 if you made a way out of this christmas 
 straight from the page of my class.. 
 i went to cheesecake, he was a motherfucking waiter there 
 
 sun in the sky, get it right 
 when a nigga can't get out that's all them can do say wah, say wah 
 that's all that all that 
 i do the most say with me 
 my reign is the press? 
 either they know or what we doin'? mama 
 
 they say you're right, aight
