 niggas fantasize about me, sleep 
 
 [kanye west - verse 1] 
 didn't you know that i said, in " and then why i ever love again 
 that'd be more focused 
 i hate the pressure, no be me 
 so we could both " 
 
 that's right put in work 
 move your ass, go wizzerk go wizzerk 
 eat your salad, no dessert eat your salad, no dessert 
 start to poke on birth control stuck to hold up 
 try to save the milk, do you remember when i make it 
 i do at least nobody too dope 
 so i can't jeopardize that for one of these hoes 
 so i feel like i'm worth girl 
 you aint neva stood for no sh.. like this, mami 
 get caught cheating and i heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today. 
 it feel like the promise rock 
 power to make 'em tuck they whole summer in 
 the clothes, cars, money, girls and the clothes got taller 
 and excuse me hands in the air if you donâ€™t really care
