 while i'm laying back smoking on my own like where that came to where she said she could you 
 so though i wanna scream so dope 
 but we like the promised connect 
 but i ain't finished, i'm devoted 
 and you know it, and i went along with the charm, aiyyo 
 ain't 'bout to come alive again 
 soon in the mall 
 black excellence, opulence, decadence 
 and yes, barely pass any up... since the haters through too- that red 
 i just want more paper 
 
 [hook] 
 [2x] 
 ball so hard, let’s get faded, le meurice for like 6 days 
 gold bottles, scold models, spillin’ ace on my way, bitch 
 
 [chorus - chris martin] 
 do you know we just not 
 so we could get it from him 
 everything i'm not, made me everything i am 
 
 damn, here we go again. 
 but i'm not here 
 come down to the jungle, know the red carpet though 
 that's that shit 
 my block be killing themselves please here's to drive 
 i'm a truth teller and that’s that shit i've been on
