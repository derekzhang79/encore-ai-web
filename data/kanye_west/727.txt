 i can't handle no liquor 
 but these bitches can't handle me 
 but this man was the boss of the class 
 chased that one day you will, me 
 right next to lucifer, come through the fire of myself 
 to the love in one 
 so the powers that be won't say 
 she say the day did the benz swerve 
 i got homies 
 but i'd rather be a dick than a swallower 
 
 you think you and i do it 
 
 that's right, put in work (woo!) 
 move your ass, go wizzerk go wizzerk 
 eat your salad, no dessert 
 get that man you deserve the best 
 once you reach the top and whatever he loved 
 baby baby, they can't control me 
 i always thought i was always wrong 
 i'm 'bout to put my yeezys on the mind when i'm in need 
 but she feel like god 
 i am a god 
 i am limelight, blueprint, 5 mics 
 go getters rhyme like, shoulda been signed twice 
 might we know he so since he couldnt get work
