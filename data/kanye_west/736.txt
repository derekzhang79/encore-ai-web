 the roc is still alive every time i hear bout other nigga's stroking you 
 and iâ€™ll never hit shit up like this 
 that's right, put in work (woo!) 
 move your ass, go wizzerk go wizzerk 
 eat your salad, no dessert (ugh!) 
 got your middle fingers up 
 middle fingers up! 
 
 [verse 2: kanye west] 
 it gets the kiss before i looked up to the light 
 or the plaques or the show is why they better back like prince in the songs 
 now, we will open 
 her love is all that i can see 
 memories made in the coldest winter 
 goodbye my friend will i ever love again 
 goodbye my friend will i'm so curious 
 she's got a lover, so the lies, and the lust, is too 
 a man dead into every class 
 chased the good life my whole life long 
 
 [kanye west] 
 i'm looking for more 
 somewhere i can call you out 
 you too wild, you too wild 
 you too wild, i need you now 
 got to thank you for your soul
