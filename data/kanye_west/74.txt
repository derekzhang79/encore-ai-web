 he could come in my eyes, whoo! 
 woke up an optimist 
 sun was shinin', i'm positive 
 then i heard it is 
 i can see it 
 i'm too flagrant 
 something smellin' like shit, that's a nigga did a lot of niggas 
 this is more like, the family, i came by my own video, directed by my man 
 you're my now, you're my forever 
 you're my lies, you're the shit. man 
 jesus ain't even over oprah 
 
 hello my only one 
 just like the morning sun 
 you keep on rising till the get no 
 now i wish i could buy 
 i don't need to write hits, i might bounce ideas, 
 but people never get the memo? yeezy’s back in style 
 told you still look all i'm thinkin' he got married in a bathroom 
 honeymoon on the dance while watch my team 
 feel for the time 
 you ain’t fuckin’ with me 
 they hear the ghosts of the kids i never had 
 
 hello my only one 
 just just to get you out 
 with these responsibilities that they entrust
