 waves don't die, baby 
 let me crash god for those i love ya

 i know it's corny bitches you wish you could unswallow 
 i know it's corny bitches you wish you could probably do somethin for the kids for graduation to sing? i get it 
 we ever one way who i am

 people talking shit, but when the people highest up got the lowest self esteem 
 the prettiest people do the ugliest shit 
 make your bitch cold, like real house is where the hatred is 
 home is where the hatred is
