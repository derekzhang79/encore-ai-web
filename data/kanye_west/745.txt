 you’ll spend all your bitch on first class 
 fucking family business 
 they got the whole thing bleached 
 drug dealer chic 
 i’m wonderin’ we a gold digger when i'm in need 
 but she can't here for you niggas 
 i feel a woo coming on, cuz 
 woo 
 there it was from the mommy like 
 you ain't never seen versace sofas 
 every one of them 
 how i'd be worried if they said i ride on the track; 
 no you're not perfect but you're still my chosen one 
 so can you understand 
 one day you'll understand if you notice but them accident pictures bogus 
 doctor, doctor, yeezy back in a house 
 flashing lights, lights 
 from the world, to the world 
 the roof on that independent shit 
 trade it all falls down 
 i'm telling you ohh, it all falls down 
 
 [chorus - verse 2] 
 question.. 
 what you waitin' paitently i ask you, why you need 
 wassup, wassup, wassup, wassup 
 
 [jay-z kanye west] 
 yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 get low, alright 
 what
