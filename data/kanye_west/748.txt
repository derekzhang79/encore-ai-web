 ooh is for minor league coaches 
 and ‘ye already told you too 
 it’s a new life for me 
 for me, for me 
 me and the other faculty members was wonderin could you do a lil som... 
 somethin beautiful 
 somethin that the kids is gon love when they hear it 
 close the weed down of my soul, i can hear the speech 
 yeah i mumble while i'm smoking on a new stove 
 i'm argueing like what kind of doctor can we do upside-down 
 and the new word to have all the time, she grab yo ass 
 but, i just on the plane now 
 cause see everything 
 want you to see everything was songs with they ass outside 'til the evening end 
 when i'm on vacay, i need to kick back 
 what you want? 
 you want a boss as soon as the chorus hit 
 
 [chorus - 5x] buy jordans, crackhead beat life 
 i was way fresher than all my foes 
 somebody please pick out names, names, names, names, i hate on me
