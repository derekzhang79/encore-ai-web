 
 [chorus - chris martin] 
 do you know how i feel 
 breeze driftin’ on by 
 
 it’s a new life for me 
 for me givin' up's way harder than tryin' 
 lauryn hill say her heart was in school. 
 he was so gready with degrees, he took my degree. 
 and now i'm just boiling why you standing here, 
 i'm nice now 
 your eyes are bright 
 why i cook to be with us 
 may the god’s be with me 
 that's why i'd rather take the pressure, now we all pray 
 
 sun in the sky 
 you know that what the midwest is? 
 you don't look around 
 but i still hear the ghosts of the girls i said can ever come back in 'em. don't you ever come back in 'em. don't you ever come back smellin' all good, taking sips of all your magazines 
 hunger strike yourself, look 
 i'll go to la yeah 
 now i'm fourfiveseconds from wildin' 
 and we got three more days 'til friday 
 i'm just tryna make it back home by monday mornin'
