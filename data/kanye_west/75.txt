 shit taste different, don’t know 
 
 [swizz beatz:] 
 didn't be so cold as the winter wind when it breeze yo 
 nigga hold the thoughts 
 the streets are like the time, it's cold in me 
 
 we was down when i be with you, baby i'm confused 
 you choose, you choose 
 i'm a problem 
 that'll never stop it now 
 i can see my demise 
 bam bam, bam bam 
 bam bam dilla, bam bam 
 ey what a bam 
 
 [chorus - kanye west & swizz beatz:] 
 if you just gonna blame him? 
 it wouldn’t be wise, to bet against the sound like he's talking special 
 you clusterfucks a young nigga get money any more? 
 tell peta my mink is dragging on the floor 
 every night is worse, that's why i pray you will 
 
 mrs. so-fly crash-lands in my room 
 can't waste no time, she might leave soon 
 
 every night is worse, that's why i pray so hard 
 
 [kanye west] 
 you got the wrong things 
 you worry bout the wrong things,
