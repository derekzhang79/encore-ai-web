 this is god given 
 i'm gone let it off 
 get you super wet after we broke or love, the past is all in the past

 if he can move through the rumors, he can be anything in you'll die 
 when a lady walks to me says “hey u know whats sexy?”

 there's been an accident like geico

 [kanye west - verse 1] 
 i sold my soul to the globe, the [x8]
