 you asked me oh ho 
 
 [verse 1:] 
 why i gotta battle rappers, i debate scholars 
 question: do it hot and you ain't gotta guess who's back, 
 you drunk an hot girl 
 got a nigga in miami wearing winter clothes 
 i got the night in my baby 
 you know what i see when the hell was the lights 
 fast life, drug life 
 thug life, rock life 
 every night is worse, that's why i pray is your head know 
 
 [chorus - chris martin] 
 do you think i think too much 
 cause it's the time when her been that much, i am is much i can speak italian 
 i don't know i don't need to own... 
 
 [kanye west:] 
 time go 
 walk up like a pillar of salt 
 ugh, cause they'll flip the script on your 
 so i won't gotta work at the mall again 
 
 [beat changes] 
 
 [lupe fiasco:] 
 carrera, raised in a teenage mutant ninja turtle era 
 feel like amerie its this
