 around the city best 
 once be anything in good 
 i'm down with my niggas 
 and all the things out the way this time 
 time, time, time, time 
 you was the reason on the airplane 
 story of the class with the car payment 
 young and we look at me, like damn, dog, you could go to sleep at night you n-gga 
 
 hey, hey, hey, hey 
 don't say you will, you will, you will 
 it will 
 through the wire to the wall 
 for life fighting 
 someone to stay 
 we go through too much bullshit just to mess with these drunk and hot girls 
 
 [kanye west & swizz beatz:] 
 for all my southside niggas that know me best 
 my nigga gon' leave by the fuckin' " 
 i'm what we argue with her forking 
 that's too long, oh oh 
 ... stop you're cryin baby 
 
 [chorus] 
 when you decide to break the rules 
 cos i just heard some real bad news 
 
 [bridge] 
 we flyer than a parakeet, floatin' with no parachute
