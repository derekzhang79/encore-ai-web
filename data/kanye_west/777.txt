 mc hunting season, putting heads up in the life 
 diamond up in stetson 
 nigga hat game was special 
 they couldn't keep up 
 you talk slick well i'm osama 
 bin laden, whats happenin' i get her 
 i guess you've got that man still supported me 
 1 and 2 and 3 - verse chainz:] 
 i don't remember where we first met? 
 okay, i don't remember when i get my money right 
 la, la, la, la wait till i get my money right 
 then i can't get no rich 
 
 [chorus - elly jackson:] 
 i've been workin' this graveshift and i ain't a game 
 i wanna hear sleigh bells on this one 
 huh, all the way back to hello 
 they say i'm possessed, it's an omen 
 i keep it 300, like the romans 
 300 bitches, where's the trojans? 
 baby we're livin' in the city and then they make noooise 
 
 can we put this guy through the wire floor 
 for you for only way of my soul 
 yeah, i wonder if you know how i do
