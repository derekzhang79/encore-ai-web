 i'm tryna get her back blew the glass 
 heart will rock the fires did it 
 i'ma get the kids gonna bring some million a nba player 
 and who you are now watching the throne 
 don't spend no money 
 ain't got no clothes got no money 
 we got no idea what you're dealing with 
 something on the pulpit. 
 we took that ass, in 
 indian hair, no moccasins 
 it's too many hoes in this world, i made their way up 
 thirty little who made a million a minute, we made a million a minute 
 we ain't married but tonight 
 i thought my whole collectionâ€™s so cool 
 the good life, it feel like l.a., it feel like d.c. 
 it feel like miami 
 before i run to sleep at night you n-gga 
 
 hey, hey, hey, hey 
 i admit i 
 
 hey, hey, hey, hey 
 don't say you will 
 one day you got the new shit on the fan 
 everything i'm not, made me everything i am 
 i'm doin' things my way, it's my way of thinking,
