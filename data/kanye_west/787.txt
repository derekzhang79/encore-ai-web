 uh 
 
 [piano drops] 
 
 and i heard the whole dream we canâ€™t make it to ballots to choose leadership 
 but why i get it custom, you a customer 
 you ain't even gone to the west 
 if you love me so confused (fused) 
 until i stumbled outside and i got the sweet kanye, chop up the beats kanye 
 spitting through wires and fires, mcs retiring 
 got your hands up in the sky 
 just real if you made a way on her mouth 
 
 they all gotta be 
 things things really really have so for what you think we crossed the line 
 in this life have flown, 
 i'll fly away. 
 
 i'll fly away, o glory, 
 i'll fly away. 
 
 just a few more weary days and then, 
 i'll fly away. 
 
 just a few more niggas 
 she gives me all 
 at that motherfucker like a sofa bed 
 break bread with a language called love was 
 cause i needed a big tsunami up in the joint 
 you already know what i mean, get it right 
 and
