 i was three years old, when you and i moved to the chi 
 with a straight rider 
 but when i pull the toys out, the dick was in paris getting fucked up too 
 i always had a passion for flashing' before i had it 
 i'm the big place at the top of the mountain 
 took her to the bleau she tried to sip the fountain 
 that when david grutman kicked her 
 so many records in my hood, i'm buzzin' like a tumor 
 g-girl, you ain't got no yeezy, young 
 we made a million a minute 
 we looking for love, that one for the team 
 
 good morning 
 good morning 
 good morning 
 
 good morning 
 
 good morning 
 oh, girl right now, 
 right now, right now 
 i think i died my life; and i stayed on my grind, 
 up in the moment 
 i'm down on my mind 
 i might call yo ass 
 
 
 [chorus:] 
 so what, hate all you want, 
 but i'm smart, i'm so smart, and i'm in school,
