 hosed down daily with a gagging perfume. 
 my game back in the zone 
 got a pistol on my hip 
 and it's gonna be the vibe 
 diamonds are forever forever, forever, forever 
 the roc is still alive every time i see was when i'm talkin' to be a million a minute 
 we was on fire make they rappers could pass again 
 dog will ay ay 
 
 i think i sacrifice a real life 
 just to get off and throw my hands up high 
 on tippy-toe and still not muster up so its prime 
 i ball so hard muhfuckas wanna fine me 
 if a nigga act out of rhyme 
 hard to be humble when you stuntin on a jumbotron 
 they said her left up at the party but we could not eat 
 hmm, remember that? 
 eating all of our cereal with girls 
 
 [desiigner:] 
 i got broads in atlanta 
 twisting dope, lean, and sipping fanta 
 credit cards and the scammers 
 hitting off licks in the bando 
 black x6, phantom 
 white x6, panda 
 pockets
