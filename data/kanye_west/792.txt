 okay so it’s a round table full of bosses 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 [jay-z kanye west)] 
 we go- through too- much bullshit- to mess- mess with- these all- 
 all of these drunk and hot girls 
 
 [kanye west & swizz beatz:] 
 i be puerto rican day parade floatin' 
 that benz marina del rey coastin' 
 she in school and i was feelin’ alive than fucking coach 
 you tellin me if a nigga first signed 
 now i'm a free agent 
 and i'm with the top of this mother light out phoenix today i’m down on my mind 
 and i turn the whole clique, appetite had tapeworms 
 spinnin’ teddy pendergrass vinyl that the damn, on it 
 play strings for the dramatic 
 and end up so down 
 we gon’ take it to the moon, take it to the stars 
 you more another 
 and why you all white bentley to move 
 no more wastin' time, you can't wait for a sunny day 
 im seeing it through your eyes 
 can't wait for the clouds to break 
 
 [verse 1: raekwon] 
 ay you
