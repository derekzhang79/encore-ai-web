 i'm mixed now, fleshed out 
 there's light with no heat 
 we cooled out, it's cool out 
 life is precious 
 we found out 
 we found out 
 we found out 
 we found out 
 turned out, oh 
 i had gone with my friend, and i won't touch anything 
 i had to put this friends if you will 
 i pray you will 
 
 mrs. so-fly crash-lands in the club 
 bam bam dilla, bam bam 
 you to need a big truck, pull ya keys out 
 girls go wild 
 reach for the cool from 
 that the power would sell me to cum all over her damn face 
 i got somethin else to do 
 you look how i try this shit for 
 an a motherfucker payment 
 new clothes 
 but it was outlandish spending 
 the bitch did a told you this much 
 all the way out of this house when i speak of his son 
 these niggas ain't ready for action 
 ready, ready for action 
 
 four late in chicago like bright lights...
