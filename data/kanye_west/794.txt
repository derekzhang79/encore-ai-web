 gave him of the blind 
 the clouds are movin' 
 i think i need some consummation 
 
 [kanye west & the-dream:] 
 i'm gonna marry your daughter 
 and at the top we gon’ take it to the flight and 
 i got the world in my hands, the pretty icons have a baby she gon' have nothin', ooh! 
 but i'm your only one 
 i got the fine one 
 i got you a six pack shakuar and stuff come head and ay 
 you should go head 
 and live my life 
 and my last vacation 
 and, man, i know i can see it 
 so now we just resent it 
 i step on our road 
 bad decisions, damn your ass like wesley and spike 
 you realize we just blessed to be alive, we at war we killin that, with capitol shit 
 if you loved you 'bout up on the mink is dragging on the floor 
 can i mighta just loosened a tooth 
 spittin’ what i just fucked wit you 
 before the glory - 
 chi city, chi city 
 
 [chorus - sampha:]
