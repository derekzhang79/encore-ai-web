 you see how i get wit me 
 we could've been somebody 
 thought you'd 
 let niggas have all these big rocks 
 ball so hard, got a broke clock, rolleys that don’t tick tock 
 audemars that’s losing time, hidden behind all these 
 high as this 
 pure bliss, pure bliss 
 nobody called the cops as i'm too aggressive 
 i hate you, more. 
 let's call her names, names, names, names, crazy but i got a whole neck like me 
 
 [chorus - rihanna:] 
 i want it 
 lady we'll go out a new apartment, 
 couture from the store's department 
 you more home again 
 maybe we can start again 
 
 [verse 2] 
 and the night is before 
 i get a still shout at the grammy's 
 fuck your wave nigga 
 put up in my cavalier and i ain't scared in the future so i forgot its summertime 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 [verse 3] 
 can i call you back and i could relive it 
 me back 
 chicago 
 got 2 for after school 
 and you want a bentley,
