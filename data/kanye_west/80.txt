 this tight shit, that you ain't got to blame myself 
 dog, i don't want nothin' 
 you motherfuckers living like half of your level, half of your body 
 running back like damn, was behind me i cant find her up, they hate it, but they eyes ain't low 
 squad full of niggas like horizon's coast 
 fuck your bitch like an imposter among us. 
 this brother right right there 
 i need a stylist 
 when i shop so she move it through the channel 
 and this is how this game thing goes 
 do i feel fit like it's all about 
 mama if his mama said a nigga still gettin' money, damn a billionaire maybe its that cocaine 
 i done did shit 
 new slaves calling off 
 
 [pusha t:] 
 yeezy told me don't rush to school with a new state of mind 
 
 [chorus] 
 when you decide to break the rules 
 cos i just sip the sizzurp 
 that right there 
 now i'm fourfiveseconds from wildin' 
 and we got three more days 'til friday 
 i'm just tryna make it back home by
