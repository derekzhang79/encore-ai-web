 she feels in hell, i’m expecting heaven, i’m owed, 
 i’m throwed and i was hit on my bike 
 and i was actaully in my body i used to love with the feeling you a faithful trance 
 that perfect glance, your thirsty grin 
 over in harlem 
 right after bright 
 the end of the house lit up, pull ya sleeves out 
 push a big truck, pull you up maña-naaaaaaaaaa!
