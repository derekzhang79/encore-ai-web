 when i say you're living like you died before 
 i got something better than hov, but i’m talking george tenet 
 i am a god 
 i know i said i'm through, but they always hatin 
 leaving me for wilin out 
 i'm mixed now, fleshed out 
 there's light with no heat 
 we cooled out, it's cool out 
 life is precious 
 we found out, we found out 
 we found out 
 we found out 
 we found out 
 we found out 
 we found out 
 we found out 
 we found out 
 we found out 
 we found out 
 we found out 
 who i am 
 she said i am limelight, blueprint, 5 mics go wizzerk 
 eat your salad, no dessert

 it's kanye's workout plan allow myself to introduce myself to stay 
 my 15 seconds up, but i ain't dropped shit on logical
