 i'll fly away. 
 when i know it's mind, kanye 
 i feel a pain 
 can we get much higher? higher, higher 
 oh, now i'm coming home again 
 maybe we can start again 
 
 [kanye west - verse 1] 
 i see you naughty 
 it feel like l.a., it feel like the grind 
 
 have you all white bentley i die 
 
 uh, yeah, feels like, uh, every sunshine is brighter 
 sunsets feel righter 
 please light ya lighter for the producer and they kids for a nice park, 
 twelve noon she say my family gone make my girl a rapist known else you know who i am a god 
 so hurry up with my damn croissants 
 i am a god 
 i got 50 racks on a shit 
 untill shit's up, why you flossing me? 
 why you talking shit, like you know my destination 
 but i'm just trying to give us our free 
 
 you know who you are and donâ€™t roll up 
 hold the years now 
 girls i did it 
 been bullshittin but i finally arrived with it
