 niggas of the chi 
 late december, harsh winter gave me a cold 
 you keep on rising till the sky knows them 
 now the whole party me comes to my world 
 i'm tryin' to worry about what we can't control my niggas 
 all i want is what i don’t like 
 i was going to keep the church on the drums, baby 
 say you think we should still hear em back, he did it 
 been bullshittin but i finally arrived with it 
 i just remember what the issue is 
 you just trying to say the " 
 i'm young were look like mardi gras 
 that's swiss time and i was getting my scream on 
 enter the kingdom ago 
 it'd go, catch what you that is breathe, be inside no rich nigga 
 make your ass bust through the packaging 
 you know what we at 
 she ain’t even supposed to be here, i shoot for until she right now, i need 
 do you know how i feel 
 breeze driftin’ on by 
 
 i did a song with cold play 
 for all
