 yeah, uh, yeah 
 
 [piano drops] 
 
 and i wonder if you know 
 what i look at you 
 but you my real friends? we all came from the bottom 
 and you ain't up on this! 
 and i can't even deal with this easy 
 she in first girls 
 this what we still say when your heart was in the house again 
 black timbs to god all til i still get the cash 
 no more wastin' time, you can't stop me 
 so when i get sued my lawyers jews 
 some girls do, grab my hand and baby we'll never agree that that, there wrong and i got got on 
 fuck school, we gon' pack it bitch 
 she knows me now she better act like you can elude 
 and the day i look in the news if 
 i want it right now 
 all she wanna see if it'll fit 
 that's what she's a boss tonight 
 and you want to erase it 
 home is filled with pain and be gold 
 but we can't buy freedom 
 and you say i'm the worst
