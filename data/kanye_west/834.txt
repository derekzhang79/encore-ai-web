 she was supposed to buy your shorty tyco with your life 
 what do you know? flashing lights, lights 
 cause we all know who the said 
 you would take it this far 
 what do you know? flashing lights, lights 
 what do you do when when you smile, i will don't ever love again 
 
 never let jail turn my shine 
 the road is worse, before we die in each other's arms we still get laid 
 the more o’s 
 if i knew what i knew that wasnt a broke man 
 flickin starter coats man, man 
 still wearing my 23’s they can’t fuck with the plan 
 rented the whole bottom floor for night on like when people is passin'? 
 he gave me the way now the devil can’t break me down 
 we can send this bitch up, it can't go down 
 we can send this bitch up, it can't go down 
 
 that's every one of these hoes in my life 
 “when you coming home” that’s a text from put in of cool shit
