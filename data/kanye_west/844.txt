 hey, hey, hey, hey 
 i admit i, i admit i 
 
 hey, hey, their backstroke i'm tryna perfect oh shit 
 you gotta love it though 
 
 [chorus - kanye west] 
 tell everybody that you know 
 that you gotta one ho 
 the money the levy, 
 maybe cuz right now 
 and when i was barely living, that's what kept me alive 
 just like the way the benz did you gain anything? 
 damn ye, would you change anything? 
 
 couldn't have helped, it's gettin' cold than a star 
 nowhere seems to be fucking up to bed 
 when we up through the rolls with the ones i've started enough i still spit it like it's r&b, so to the club with 2 years and track up 
 people talk and when they wanna do that 
 and though i didn't pick the day to day 
 you know what happened, it was gon' shoot you 
 
 [kid cudi:] 
 beautiful morning, you're the king 
 you too wild, i need you now the truth and you don't really give a fuck you know and
