 run for the night 
 down for the night 
 said she's down for the night 
 down for the scumbags, 
 every one of these motherfuckers down 
 with a little bad advice 
 on one of those bad nights, ya'll fucking kidding? 
 my momma couldn't get through to me. 
 the drama, people suing me, 
 i'm on my way home 
 i feel it 
 yes, deep inside 
 deep, deep, down inside 
 i feel it 
 i'ma rock the boat through too much bullshit just to mess with these drunk and hot girls 
 a little girl that say that you could probably do somethin for the kids for the world 
 now i ain't got the album but all of these days 
 they when i blow past and be up 
 they fuck you look at my face, do i get my money right 
 but no one seems to know i'm gone 
 home is where the hate is 
 my dome is where fate is 
 i stroll where souls get lost like vegas 
 seen through yves st. laurent glasses
