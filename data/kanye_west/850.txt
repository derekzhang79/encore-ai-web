 you say look at my degrees and you look at my life, 
 
 you can't believe 
 single black female addicted to retail and well 
 
 [hook] 
 
 [verse 3 - kanye west:] 
 if i go outside, i got to leave this moment, and take it to the chi 
 when you hop back in the house 
 if she gone pull through 
 we gon’ take it to the moon, take it to the car 
 and now i'm still gon' be here in the morning 
 no lie 
 no lie 
 no lie 
 no lie 
 asking yeezy got the roc in this soul 
 throw up in my head, yes i get mine 
 around the same time she had fell in love with him 
 
 see you know my style is? 
 i won't wear the pride in my neck 
 what's scary to me is henny makes us stronger, my brotha 
 i’m living enough 
 i did a bad bitch 
 
 you forget my family gone 
 what you want a bentley, fur coat and start with the lie 
 no run around like
