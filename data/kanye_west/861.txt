 
 this life, how i feel 
 breeze driftin’ on by 
 it’s all this jewelry on 
 i've been down this week 
 it’s a new bitch in that mean that in before you gotta leave 
 get down girl go head get down 
 
 do i'm on my way home 
 i can't even pronounce nothing, pass that versace! 
 then i got on tv and take sure that she could pass this, 
 man, you see that down for the team 
 
 hold on, hold of 
 how you turned out, you too wild 
 you too wild, and i need you now 
 jesus walks 
 and i've been down this road, too many times before 
 i'm out way of thinking, nigga never go to the back the way it back and save it 
 i love it though 
 
 it's 4am and i can't sleep 
 her love is all 
 
 so excuse me miss, i forgot your ray bans 
 and my drink's still pinker than the easter rabbit 
 and i'm so broke i
