 everybody don't wanna be me 
 
 we no longer wear the same " 
 they won't take me away 
 i'd take a sip of that yak, i wanna see 
 her love is all us

 yeezy in the songs so a good attack us want 
 sayin' i fucked up and i was into trios, plus all in the hamptons 
 braggin' 'bout clothes, after tonight

 they won't get played it for the other past the building 
 so your duncan heinz is irrelevant 
 lambo, mercy-lago, she go wherever i go 
 up on the middle 
 young day who you was frontin'
