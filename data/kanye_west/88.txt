 and i look at my check, wasn't no scratch

 cause i was god man

 i know the city gettin' ready for me 
 i know you see me now right now

 i never told you to kill kanye 
 i even had to wake up 
 cuz i gotta get inside i still feel the notes and let it shine 
 when i park my range rover, slightly scratch your corolla 
 okay, i smashed your corolla, i'm hanging on a hangover 
 back when they get bubbly 
 at nyu but at least you all feel something
