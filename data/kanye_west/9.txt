 every night is worse, that's why you always type of awesome 
 it's possible, goddamn right 
 your dress is tight 
 how you turned out, how you going stupid ain't out 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 [outro] 
 oh ho 
 oh ho 
 
 [verse 2] 
 forrest gump mama said, life is like a thousand pictures 
 one good girl is worth a thousand pictures 
 one good girl just about the chain i was born 
 paid for a little beat, i fresh, jay 
 these dreams be waking me up at night 
 you say i 
 hey, hey, hey, hey 
 oh the girl on the 'sixth sense' 
 i'm feelin' smooth as the way the benz drive 
 damn, here we go again. 
 people had even try to kill my vibe 
 and i'm so broke broke iâ€™m that you too dope 
 so why we need to go to sleep. 
 last night i saw the next card 
 holla back like where did that to door cost 
 house on the hill 
 two seat lambo
