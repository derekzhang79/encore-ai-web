 late you the best friend much mine 
 one night 
 digging paul revere and nat turner as the good guys 
 america stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes 
 the signs of truth and i'm back on my grind 
 a psychic read my big brother, was my face is my momma stew 
 never be another motherfuckers 
 around the world lost in the world 
 
 [verse 1 - kanye west:] 
 now, when i find your apartments 
 we were young it's real when i would even take the snow away 
 if spring can take the snow away 
 can it melt away all of our mistakes 
 memories made in the coldest winter 
 
 it's 4am and i can't sleep 
 her love is on that norman mailer shit 
 in this bitch, get a cake 
 bitch 
 didn’t you see, if you ever wanted to ever be the nicest; you aint get gangsta or buy a whole lot of 0’s 
 what you niggas ready 
 and don't front and i don't like the most now off 
 straight liquorice you niggas sound
