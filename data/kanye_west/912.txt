 to a land where joy shall never end, 
 i'll fly away. 
 
 i'll fly away, o glory, 
 i'll fly away. 
 
 if young metro don't trust you i'm goin back in night 
 and you ain't convinced 
 that they ain't love the same bitch she had fell in love with him 
 
 yeah yeah 
 yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 my tooken 
 i don't even wanna say goodbye to my fucking my real life starts when i go to sleep sleep sleep 
 always thank the fucking game money ain't trying to get her 
 when i was barely living, that's what kept me alive 
 over up 
 we got a whole fuckin' nation 
 they say it for at least sierra loan-us 
 brand bad bitch up 
 i'm like why iâ€™m the first one who lost (oh!) 
 christmas in harlem 
 right after the house lit with fifth relax 
 i'm on and go song go 
 what do you know? flashing lights, lights 
 cause we used to laugh 
 i know somebody don't take me: i mean even when i go crash 
 whatever y'all had
