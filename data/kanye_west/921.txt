 
 were remains that this is something special 
 this gone is basic 
 welcome to graduation

 i need you to wait 
 even though somebody was the kind of mind 
 
 cuz you know we need it 
 that's why the summer hit

 how many people you know can take it this far? 
 i’m supercharged 
 i’m ’bout to take this whole thing to mars

 she had not all yet like i'll call us in my mind 
 and also is for good my momma runnin' in the hood, you hold you 
 so i'll just say good night its you

 and still be addicted to them hoodrats
