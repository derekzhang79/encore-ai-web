 i’m trynna get you back 
 we drop the blunt and disrespect the weed was all up 
 and get it jukking in the world 
 to the world, to the world 
 till you don’t know what we been through to make it this far 
 so many scars 
 ‘bout to take this whole thing to mars 
 
 now we gon’ even of the principle 
 they got the cd then got to see me drop gems 
 like i dropped out of p.e. 
 they used to do kanye, whatever else it still be holding me on the mausoleum floor 
 that's right my cuz 
 she gave me the best years of her else 
 get a fur! you get a fur! 
 you get a jet! big booty bitch for you! woo! 
 they could come through the streets 
 bumping r&b 
 and keep it loopy, i know you're living it up 
 
 i finally got my kids together in my head 
 aint a damn thing 
 you in the back don't like me though (why!?) 
 i don't know the old me
