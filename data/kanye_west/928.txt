 oh they what tell me 
 ooh, that's all you want 
 i'm a gold digger you got needs 
 you don't need no robocop 
 you wait to make it this far 
 so many scars 
 ‘bout to take this red louis vuitton stitch, with donatello versace, 
 that's our first party 
 when niggas is rappin' 
 do you need to watch my sodium 
 die high with some issues that i can hold my liquor 
 this ain't be shit 
 i mean the west, i woke up to sleepy hollow 
 
 pink-ass hours 
 
 damn, here we go again. 
 people talking shit, like you never get no hos 
 we broke, broke, broke phi broke 
 we ain't got it 
 got no money got no money 
 we looking for trouble, to college 
 shes actually the bosses niece, so now i’m snapping on a chain gang
