 then i finally got some grey shit 
 damn the way i wanted to 
 what i still get laid 
 
 [chorus:] 
 no one ain't around 
 i know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow 
 i know it's corny bitches you wish you could unswallow 
 i know it's corny bitches you wish you could unswallow 
 i know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow 
 i know that we could not eat 
 hmm, remember that? 
 eating all of our cereal with forks because we wanted to save the milk, do you remember that? hmm? 
 do you remember all those christmases when your mama walked in the room and pretended she was the tree, huh? 
 remember that? 
 eating all of our cereal with forks because we wanted to save the milk, do you remember that? hmm? 
 do you remember when the gifts 
 new money, i found the fountain of youth 
 iâ€™m headed to miami to fuck up the fontaine bleu 
 a case of ace, make them high than be smart. 
 you know why? 
 and i tell you i ride for
