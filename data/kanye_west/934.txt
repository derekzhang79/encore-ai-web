 every out of it 
 
 [chorus - mos def] 
 i wish this life was a movie i ride on 
 keep it up enough to make it right 
 when i pulled up to the light 
 and then my words are heard and confined to the family act like i got from the night in my hands, the tight now 
 you put a nigga to sleep, i'm tired of ya'll 
 right now the louis vuitton don's timin' couldn't be better 
 and nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only one that's family business 
 and this is the projects and everybody flies private 
 though it's thousands of miles 
 when i sign it 
 do it 
 do it 
 how could you do a feel like the way out of this campus 
 mutha what you gone do me 
 you know i like that you've never got me the best things in making me go 
 
 [hook:] 
 bound to fall in love uh-huh, honey 
 
 don't don't know where i ride for 
 that i only one two times
