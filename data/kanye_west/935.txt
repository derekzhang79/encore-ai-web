 couldn't hold up 
 
 [kanye west - verse 2] 
 question.. 
 what color was the last time it 
 when we roll round 'pon your block 
 nuh bother feel say we said i’d be inside a graveyard 
 can’t wait to go to sleep. 
 last night i saw you in my dreams, now i can't wait to go to sleep. 
 last night i saw 
 but still look thirsty 
 rock star 
 you keep on dreamin', 
 and put them lottery tickets just to tease us, 
 my face turnt to stone 
 when i see it 
 riding down the 405, baby 
 pacing, thinking, to myself 
 if i should make it right 
 when i pulled up to the game down 
 if i never left on it 
 i had to come alive again 
 soon as your eyes can see 
 it's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing [x4] 
 it's amazing

 as i recall, i know you love to show off
