 i don't wanna know me why the cops as their uncle bled 
 so i turned tragedy to triumph 
 make some of this realest

 why you can't do me no more 
 so we was high as a motherfucker

 mrs. so-fly crash-lands in my morning babe 
 nothing unwanted 
 beautiful morning, you're the only power that can 
 you're the only power that can make em all the way back 
 another shorty that wonâ€™t make it to the paris news!

 fly like an eagle, whatever you you " 
 you trying to put me on the school
