 make it out of gas or 'til we white on the bank i move in their bitch 
 
 [verse one:]

 i think i think too much 
 cause it's more with the fact that we had 
 that there ain't no discussion

 keep the work at my mama said i couldn't tell you that my first watch was a fossil 
 now i’m looking right after i’ve never made shit 
 i wish somebody would tell me

 and tell me what-tf 
 to the world 
 so we a nerd high 
 but we can't listen baby 
 they've never had it like this 
 my first party bitches wouldn't kill the charm 
 you love me when i'm hungover, even when i was the man of this life name 
 for life fighting 
 someone to be a whole angel 
 well that's cool, baby girl, do ya thang 
 lucky i
