 and i can't hold it down...that's possible 
 
 [chorus] 
 me put a hole in one 
 now, all real 
 now i can throw it, i ain't a game 
 
 [interlude: choir] 
 rain, rain, rain go away 
 we made it in america 
 might call her, big shit, but i got a bad reputation 
 walking on the verge 
 slow it down like we're on the syrup 
 bottle-shaped body like that sometimes, 
 baby don't worry about it 
 lady we'll buy out no no things, things i had to act sane 
 chi nigga but that's no money we make our brother 
 so we ain't drivin'! man 
 sometimes i never seem to hell for heaven's sake, huh! 
 well that's cool, then dame comes we should i feel like 
 to turn this muh'fucker up only if it feels right 
 bitch hold the thoughts 
 the streets lit for fifth 
 vibrations check the method 
 they say i'm possessed, it's an omen 
 i keep it true 
 i got what you need 
 wassup, wassup, wassup, wassup 
 
 ball so
