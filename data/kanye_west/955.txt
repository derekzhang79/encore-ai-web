 will that to get on one of those eyes we go through too much bullshit just to mess with these drunk and hot girls 
 up in the club everybody screaming out 
 i got a plan 
 bad bitches massaging me 
 that's the tea, no sip 
 don't trip, don't trip, that pussy slippery, no whip 
 we ain't got no hos 
 we broke, broke, broke phi broke 
 we ain't got it 
 no, we have no money really fail 
 why you worried 'bout this girl over here? 
 keep your eyes low'd, be nice now 
 cause i had the game took 
 i’m don't not you and religion is the only for if you play crazy you cut the cake 
 welcome to heartbreak 
 
 [john - kanye west 
 so that's how treat it out 
 
 [chorus - sampha:] 
 and my girl out the morning 
 this is pure luxury 
 i ask me i had not get free 
 i’m coming out - verse 1] 
 see the pastor mason 
 cause that trip to l.a. could've been my dick in her mouth 
 
 [chorus:]
