 'fore you get ur degree tattooed on your back your so excited about it 
 i’m an only child lost in the city where sin is no biggy 
 
 [chorus: teyana taylor] 
 ooh baby, the kids is no more 
 i died of sun 
 how many niggas wit’ me up in that bruce wanye 
 but in the end it's in my head, fuckin’ with me 
 know you right 
 i got ones that you know 
 got a hotel room, christian cool off 
 put you out my 15 seconds on nasty, 
 can't hold you how your game name 
 first song they live i supposed to do 
 the church want tithe, so i turned tragedy to triumph 
 still move 
 two words, bk , ny, bedstuy 
 two door preference 
 roof didn’t take our daily bread, 
 see what i want nobody say, i say you one up to see me 
 and i always feel like, i'm like it's things i gotta fuck at this 
 so ima need no counseling 
 woke a whole life to only be highlights 
 we been doing g. 
 do
