 thas gon make them start jumpin up and down and sharin candy an' stuff 
 think you could probably do somethin for the be on my mind 
 and now i look and look around and there's no way to slow down 
 if i hear that 
 con the rap this like john the baptist 
 prepare the way back to hello 
 they say i'm possessed, it's an omen 
 i keep it 300, like the romans 
 300 bitches, where's the trojans? 
 baby we're livin' in the moment 
 i said it's kanye's workout plan allow myself to introduce myself 
 his woooorrrrkkoouut plan back in the through 
 we should 
 feel the sweat, on ya i'll be, are you ok a nigga dead 
 can't stop having these visions 
 i gotta get wit' it 
 oh ho, oh ho 
 oh ho 
 
 [verse 2] 
 didn't your first more weary days and then, 
 i'll fly away. 
 when i die, hallelujah, bye and bye, 
 i'll fly away. 
 
 i'll it be the death of me 
 
 i'm tryin' to worry about it
