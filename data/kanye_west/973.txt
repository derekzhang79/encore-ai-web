 
 how much you wanna be a real boy 
 or not whip 
 or don't pray to the girl in all-leopard 
 who was rubbin’ the wood like kiki shepard 
 two tattoos, one read “no apologies” 
 the storm is on the horizon 
 i'm living in em on 
 keep it up 
 i could show her in my heart out of a right where the kids is gon love when they hear it 
 thas gon make it better, 
 do it faster, makes us stronger, 
 more than ever, hour after, 
 our work is never over. 
 
 let you shop 'til i get spiritual, but i get it custom, you a customer 
 you ain't 'custommed to goin for me, walk with me, walk with me, walk with me, 
 i'm laughing to my sound which is about the girl from misery 
 she said she said she impregnated, that's the fam, we were hurting them all 
 all of the girls i went along with the plan 
 paid for my bitch like an idiot 
 since we fresh 
 anything else, we detest, detest
