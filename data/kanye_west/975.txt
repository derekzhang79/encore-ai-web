 i'm on your beams 
 one set of footsteps, you was on 
 yeah, we got no clothes got no clothes 
 ain't got no cars 
 ain't got no hos 
 we broke, broke, broke phi broke 
 we ain't got it 
 broke, broke, broke phi broke 
 we ain't got it to euro make 
 power to be mine

 you too wild, and i need you now

 from the streets that the youth is missing 
 this is more than just my hand 
 no fire in the moment 
 i want this some baby oh why'd you do it 
 it take more than a mother- 
 i feel a bad reputation 
 walking 'round, always mad reputation 
 leave a pretty girl sad down 
 don't drop the blunt and disrespect the weed 
 pick up the whole dawg i used to talk to the most fly, prada 
 baby im magic, tadah!
