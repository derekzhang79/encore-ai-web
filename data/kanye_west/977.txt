 cause i ain't even dead 
 if i talk to everything i hear 'em 
 in front of me 
 i'm taking off like back in the club on a thursday? 
 she right now, this that rap god shit nigga 
 all they wanna see me 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 [verse 3] 
 talking talking talking to me 
 i wanna stop when i go outside, i got the only clothing on. 
 how many cars do we own? (none!) 
 how many cars do we own? (none!) 
 how many cars do we own? (none!) 
 how many cars do we own? (none!) 
 how many cars do we own? (none!) 
 how many cars do we own? none, sir! 
 should we let our woman go and be supposed like a photograph to my soul, 
 fury's gonna take me 10

 oh, i get lifted, yes 
 deep, deep, down inside
