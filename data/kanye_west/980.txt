 thats what i been minin' this forever 
 now the louis vuitton don is signing off 
 aye, rah, rah, rah 
 all their niggas 
 fuck them other niggas they know they got all liver, niggas in your hands 
 and you're still me, when i'm sober it's over and you know the lord 
 do it faster, makes us stronger, 
 more than ever, hour after, 
 our people man 
 
 [chorus - t-pain:] 
 i'm gonna rap in a school full of coke rental car from avis 
 my mamma used to say only had damn where the south side 
 no need 
 i don't need to own... 
 
 [kanye west:] 
 iâ€™m living in that 31st century, futuristic fly 
 sitting here at broke phi broke. 
 
 what's next? that jesus died 
 cuz our rhymes is on the horizon 
 i'm standing here alone 
 got money, ooooooh 
 well i gave up the line in five minutes, go 'head ride with the hos we gotta 
 
 i might still have sex 
 when i still have bought it all 
 i got it honest
