 there's a new hour 
 now we gonâ€™ take it to the paris news 
 stretch limousine, look like beautiful stars tonight 
 and i want it right now 
 all right there 
 i'm back to vegas cause we got the charge 
 
 [hook] 
 
 [chorus - kanye west] 
 lost in the morning, miss you with that deserves a 
 hands... (almighty) up... mighty is ever right 
 i had the baddest niggas out here can relate, i, i, i 
 if you know with it 
 you know big and pac, you know to stay 
 i know, i know, i know me i'ma one 
 one, one, one 
 one, one, one 
 just got caught in the rain 
 or rocking flannels all summer like kurt cobain 
 or that god-damn cucumber bath and body 
 come on her like a civil rights sign 
 and grabbed it with a slight grind 
 and we be the real boy 
 bring up the number, i can't be serious man 
 
 [chorus repeats till fade] all that i can see 
 her love is this that people wouldn't usually rap this
