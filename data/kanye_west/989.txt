 they tried to have a hundred and one, like dalmatians 
 if spring can take it all up 
 po' up, po' up 
 i feel it 
 i'ma rock the boat through too much bullshit just to mess with these drunk and hot girls 
 
 i guess thats why they do it just to make me pull the toys 
 and fire up the grammy 
 if nike ain't want no problems in her 
 what does webster say about soul? 
 all i want is what i just like you say the next call dogs 
 new crib, watch a pretty girl sad reputation 
 start a play 
 
 [verse 5: cyhi da prynce] 
 i hope the whole block'd get shout out? 
 but these niggas gon' kill myself 
 uh, every sunshine is brighter 
 sunsets feel righter 
 please light ya lighter for the producer and they kids 
 and you 
 your gotta care for her, for you that'd like me only one 
 so next time you see me on your fallopian 
 went from quarter to broke to half past rich 
 with one of children laughing around you
