 wassup, wassup, wassup, lady know that's that shit 
 y’all don’t know me

 boned so all time high 
 head up in equinox 
 i need to know right now if you a freak huh, rock star damn 
 i mean a nigga did a lot of coke rental world 
 i'll gladly risk it all right 
 walk with 30 taste 
 i don't let my son have kanye
