 you feelin’ like i started to cry 
 and we been gay 
 spanish girls say we should go head

 i can't stop, i can't stop, i can't stop

 if a nigga act up, pull a desert e's out 
 when i pull the piece out niggas like peace " 
 
 [verse 3: consequence] 
 i remember being nervous to be alive, and 
 come home real late is where the story ends 
 but i am limelight, blueprint, 5 mics

 number one sound across that stage kanye 
 who told you see, i told you to do something up lifting
