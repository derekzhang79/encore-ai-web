 at the mall there is no gucci i can feel my heart beat, beat, beat of a baby girl 
 come on over make me touch you do 
 let's take it all the way back to hello 
 they said i'm through, but got nothing i've forseen it, i live it 
 like eli i did it, jokes on you we still alive 
 throw your hands up in the sky 
 running hunting ' wait a second, everybody here, i'm the ghetto oprah 
 you will never stop it 
 i love the way we a chi-town nigga with a nice try 
 this is everything 
 
 [frank ocean:] 
 the rings all ring out 
 burn out, cave in 
 blackened to dark out 
 i'm a new life 
 i can't control my niggas 
 and my vision got fast 
 i think i'm possessed, it's an omen 
 i keep it true 
 i got what you do 
 hey, hey, hey, hey 
 oh the flow on 
 in the one, nine, nine,
