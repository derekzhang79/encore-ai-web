 your name, 
 i have never been through the light 
 now i do recall a good while back 
 we snuck into the circus 
 you gave me all your love 
 it's like you forgot the words you whispered to me 
 they say little girls tossing rocks at your window 
 i'll catch you 
 the small town daydream 
 lasted all day 
 i'll be your angel giving up her wings 
 as this 
 
 ooh, ooh, can't see you 
 
 by the way 
 if the flowers they shine 
 and life makes you are 
 make you feel so b-a-d 
 break you, make you sorry 
 i hope you think that little black dress 
 think of my friends that i'm obsessive and crazy 
 [album version line:] that's fine i'll tell you the beautiful like we 
 i’ve left it all behind me 
 and i’ve been holding on 
 say i’m too tired at night for all the lovebirds 
 'cause they don't know to play me 
 how's life? tell me how's your family? 
 i make it last all night 
 i’m shining like fireworks
