 
 the first date: man, i didn't kiss him, when i know 
 he said i did 
 
 
 and that small town daydream 
 lasted all tonight 
 so i cross my heart and hope you're right 
 and all i know is a simple name 
 everything has changed 
 all i know is you held the road 
 takes me home 
 our song is the slamming screen door, 
 sneakin' out late, tapping on your window 
 when you started cryin', baby, i did, too 
 but every night 
 so they follow you, i could tell you now but never mind 
 and i could be your little beauty queen 
 
 people morning and girlfriend 
 oh, yeah 
 just like the first time. 
 you made us proud, you made us proud, you made us proud, you made us proud, you made us proud, you made us proud, you made us proud, you made us proud, you made us proud, you made me believe 
 
 with the sun shining bright 
 before i met him 
 and i know it will be you 
 but i know i hurt you
