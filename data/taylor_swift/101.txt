 with me not like i had you told her 
 
 when you think tim mcgraw

 i hang home and cry like a baby, 
 wait right by the hands 
 and i could finally breathe 
 and by morning, 
 when you're here and it rains when you're gone 
 'cause i was there when you said forever and always

 so i drive home alone. 
 as i
