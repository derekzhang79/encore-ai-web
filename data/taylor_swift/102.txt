 and i don't wanna come back down 
 and watching turned on this is waiting for me 
 a girl on a mission 
 but i'm only me when i see you turn off your phone, 
 and tell me, did venus blow your flaws again 
 as you hit the brakes too soon? 
 twenty stitches in the hospital room 
 when you come me 
 gotta let nobody hurt you 
 won't finish what you are 
 but every of look on the inside 
 oh what you get is what you wanted 
 to give to feel you 
 i bet these memories 
 follow you of innocence and it smells like me 
 i want you back 
 
 oh i'm just a girl on a mission 
 but i'm still a thug time 
 but i still love you but you're on your little laugh 
 race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs 
 i could dance to this 
 i have an excellent father 
 his strength is making me stronger 
 god smiles on my guitar 
 the windows opened up 
 the wind is blowing and we're both not
