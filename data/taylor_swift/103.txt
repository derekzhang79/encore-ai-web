 i get so confused and frustrated 
 forget what he's long 
 when i ask how long you think i am tonight 
 just know we're miles from a heartbreak 
 because in the blink of the middle 
 of the fact that she's heard this 
 
 memories you can't 
 come on, come along with me. 
 
 it would take brad pitt in your eyes 
 and she'll scared in anything too soon 
 and i know that if i'm standing in your closet trying to tell me how high i can fly 
 how you are that i could touch 
 you go with you? 
 oh, daddy can i go with you? 
 oh, daddy can i go with you? 
 oh, daddy can i go with you? 
 oh, daddy can you love like i need you? 
 are you out up this far 
 waking you but how could you understand? 
 what happens if you turn away now 
 and this is where it goes 
 you chase down the newest thing, 
 and the first thing since i 
 all is calm and all the wishes on planes
