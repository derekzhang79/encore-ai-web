 he just might make you fall 
 
 and it would've felt like, 
 that could light up the whole beautiful life 
 when you said you needed space. (what?) 
 didn't you flash your green eyes at me? 
 didn't she knows just what it takes to make a pro blush 
 she got up again 
 you got the keys to get your attention 
 be you're summer midnight with starry blue eyes 
 they will face the world around love 
 
 as the stars fall down and the heavens fade 
 this girl is begging wait, wait for me 
 
 the way you look, the way you laugh, 
 the way you love with all you have, 
 i’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door. 
 don’t wait or his " 
 and i will fall in love again 
 because i either sorry for my eyes 
 all that i know was a little memory 
 through the way we smile and i was right, 
 
 tonight i’m now and all you're ever gonna be is mean 
 you're just another picture
