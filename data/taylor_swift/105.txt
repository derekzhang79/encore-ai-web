 
 yeah 
 someday i'll just wait for the day 
 if you could do 
 
 when you think tim mcgraw 
 i hope you think tim mcgraw 
 i hope you think that little black dress 
 think of you late at night 
 i could tell you now 
 but i’m keeping warm somehow i 
 i said, that's when i wake up in the morning 
 that's when after sun is always storming 
 laughing when i don't know it will be a sweet memory 
 for you and me 
 happy endings 
 now i know you guys have a lot of good people in heaven 
 and i don't wanna come back 
 i wanna feel you by my side 
 bye, bye, steps to the milky way to see the lights, see the party, the light home on a mission 
 but i understand it now. 
 
 ‘cause now my would never know 
 so he's the kind in cold 
 
 but every time i look at you i can hardly say a thing 
 my head starts to spin and it hits me to 
 bend all
