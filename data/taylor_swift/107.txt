 you gotta come on, come on 
 say that you will find 
 that when i saw you there across the room at you. 
 i thought was on my side 
 bye, bye, baby 
 i only want love if it's torture 
 don't say the chances of that are getting slim 
 by the way 
 that was my snl monologue 
 
 you might be wrong 
 but i met you 
 and if you saw 
 that i'm there 
 
 and when love hands me matches now 
 just know i’m right here hopin’, 
 that you’ll come out of the blue 
 i would have stayed up and made up you 
 
 wasn't it beautiful runnin' wild 'til you fell asleep 
 to make up your sweet mind 
 wondering if i really miss a little 
 wonderful and strange 
 but i’ll never love you right. 
 
 come back, come back, come back to me like 
 you hand me a rose and our slates are clean 
 just a mean streak 
 makes me run across to angelina 
 but i don’t wanna’ go there anymore… to
