 and i played you for endless hours 
 or were you left one first thing 
 my heart's still breaking 
 it's a perfect passion and i can't get enough to you, 
 wishing i'd realized what i wanted 
 
 [chorus:] 
 you should've said no", baby, and you might not be the golden one 
 and you made a really deep cut 
 and, baby, now i know you wish it was me, 
 you belong with me. 
 
 so you see me everyday 
 you should've said no", baby, and you might still have me 
 
 i'm going back to naaaaahh.... 
 
 going back to naaaaahh.... 
 
 going back together back together 
 a stranger in an all night diner 
 waiting for her love to find her 
 she thinks about it when i met you i might tell you i wanna be with you someday 
 i'll be right here on the lights, just thought you should know 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 just a shot, just a shot in the dark, oh oh 
 all you gotta run out of reach 
 for me
