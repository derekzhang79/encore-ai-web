 she's got her hopes up 
 got 'em up in a pretty house 
 and i love the riddles that you speak 
 and any snide remarks from my head 
 so don't want love is to walk out 
 i'll show you that i love you 
 you're gonna believe them 
 and when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you 
 ooh, ooh, come around 
 that we were 
 dreaming about you 
 when we started home it started to rain 
 
 ooh, come a little closer 
 oh, oh, oh, oh. 
 
 and your friends 
 which apparently is a crime 
 
 think that my friends are saying 
 girl, that i light up his little 
 wonderful and strange 
 meet you in warm conversation 
 we can tell me when i'm not 
 i told myself, 
 i donâ€™t think i'm strong 
 please you took the money and close your eyes, light 
 his love is good, this love is bad 
 but every time you shine, i'll shine for you 
 
 whoa, oh, i need you in a rush 
 so baby run
