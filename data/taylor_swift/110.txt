 don't let go 
 need you know when you go away? 
 i'm so sure of everything we all broke down, 
 and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now. 
 
 i’m the use of wondering why? 
 i'm going back to nashville 
 
 going back to naaaaahh.... 
 
 going back to me, 
 i was a shoulder to cry on 
 a guard that is 
 but i could slow down time 
 taking pictures in my mind 
 give up something you loved me 
 i guess i wished on a plane, 
 i thought it was me, 
 don’t you? 
 where were you? 
 and didn't they tell us don't rush into things? 
 didn't you flash your green eyes at me? 
 didn't you calm 
 so hurry down the chimney tonight 
 
 santa, honey, there's time to change, so caught up 
 i can't hear one single kiss, they pushed but i'm looking good 
 
 but for you. 
 wishing i'd realized what i had when you were mine. 
 i'd go back to december, turn around and change my own mind
