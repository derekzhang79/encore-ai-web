 
 come and trim my christmas tree 
 with some decorations bought 
 we should be 
 i'll bet you got your mom another sweater 
 and take enough like, a thing 
 
 before you go, tell me 
 
 ooh, life's so sweet right here 
 ooh, just wanna stay right here 
 ooh, keeping it young and what the things of 
 
 and when you take, you 
 this love is good, this love is bad 
 this love is alive back from the dead 
 these hands shake 
 i'm not usually you like a magazine 
 ain't it funny, rumors fly 
 and i could be your favorite blue jeans 
 and i don't wanna need you this way, 
 come back... be here, come back... be here. 
 
 can you tell me now, you’re the “now and we 
 took a wrong turn and we 
 took a good july 
 
 going out on the back of my head 
 i write your name i write your name 
 
 boys only want love if it's torture 
 don't say her love 
 it's not my fault i just couldn't
