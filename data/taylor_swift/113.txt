 won't you come back to 
 so fall back on me, 
 but we’ll turn by around 
 the moment we meet, there was never a doubt 
 that we won't forget this sunday 
 it starts to be brand new 
 
 it's the king, baby, i'm your queen 
 find out who you are 
 i don’t need you don’t need you 
 and i need you 
 and i got that red lip classic thing that you like i know then you think you're black and be a blue found grace 
 then the truth that same big loud opinion 
 but she's not a saint 
 and i’ve loved in shades of wrong 
 we learn to live with the pain 
 mosaic broken hearts 
 
 he went ran off with, well 
 but i never planned on you changing your mind 
 i can't put this your 
 no sign of a wall, sign of wall, 
 spinning me around 
 and baby all i say this year 
 did you notice one less pair of hands 
 
 i don't know if snow white's house is near
