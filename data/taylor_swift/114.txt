 take me home where we are 
 it's just me and my baby 
 the closer that we get 
 oh, i can't wait for the day i stop pretending 
 that i'm not a little girl 
 raised of the guy we tried in vain 
 to hold on to each other 
 
 so i'm the one 
 who means the most to you 
 
 but now there's nowhere to hide 
 since you pushed my love aside 
 i'm out of my head 
 hopelessly devoted to you 
 hopelessly devoted to you 
 
 but now there's nowhere to hide 
 since you pushed my love aside 
 i'm just living life and thinking... 
 
 i've found time can heal most anything 
 and you can tell me that you're sorry 
 but i do, i do, i know 
 i still mean every word i said 
 
 all my friends are saying 
 who's really bad at lying 
 so go back to december all the time 
 
 as the right out, 
 
 i know it's with me. 
 
 standing by and waiting at your backdoor.
