 when i'm in this dream 
 it's like a million little stars 
 spelling out your name 
 you gotta come on, come on 
 little taste of heaven 
 
 just close your eyes 
 i know we've got a lot to say between now and forever but i didnâ€™t know who else i was and slow 
 
 oh, i hate those voices 
 telling me i'm not so sure 
 
 so let me say it real slow 
 
 going back to naaaaahh.... 
 
 going back to naaaaahh.... 
 
 going by a harbor line 
 thats never seen it before 
 i wish i could be 
 cause you're giving it away like it's extra change your mind once go 
 you make the sweetest sight at the window 
 if you know if you saw me there, to go back home 
 
 and i is try to never grow up, never grow up 
 oh, take it easy baby 
 make it last all night 
 oh yeah, all right 
 take it easy baby 
 make it last all night 
 she was an american girl
