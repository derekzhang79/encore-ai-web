 oh, it's been crazy to let you know that what i feel is true. 
 and i don't wanna turn around 
 coz i'm not scared 
 of what love gave me and took the summer blow 
 
 down came the rain 
 there ain't no accidents in what we both stay, stay, stay, stay. 
 
 stay, stay, stay. 
 i've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time. 
 you think that it's funny when i'm mad, mad, mad. 
 so i didn't of 
 oh, oh, oh 
 but i was wrong to 
 
 we small talk, work and the weather 
 i can hear them whisper as all me 
 and i feel like i could 
 talk to you forever 
 
 can you tell me why 
 we never gone 
 we could work it out somehow 
 but that was when i ruled the world 
 
 it looks so sure 
 christmas must be something 
 christmas must be something more 
 
 there's gotta be more 
 there's gotta be more 
 there's gotta be more 
 there's a shortcut to the highway out of town in
