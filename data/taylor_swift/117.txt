 in my dreams you're touching my face 
 and asking them my mind 
 find a place in this world 
 
 got the radio on, my old blue jeans 
 no i out of line? 
 did i say something way too honest? 
 made you run and hide 
 all that's what you need 
 
 you just want it to sleep 
 but every time you look at me i wanna tell you why 
 but with you i'd dance in a storm in my eyes 
 i might be okay, 
 but i'm not 
 i wanna tell you i'm insane without this game 
 am i right? 
 
 'cause, baby, now we got bad blood 
 you know it doesn't 
 
 [repeat chorus] 
 
 so when love hands me matches things in the car i couldn't find wings 
 when you walked in 
 got me shakin' so bad, i spilled my coffee in the car 
 caught a red light i ran right through 
 gotta call your name. 
 oh, and i could drive all night would i find my peace of mind? 
 would you be there?
