 all you wanted was to be wanted 
 wish you could go back and tell me how to feel. 
 this perfect weather 
 there's your trouble 
 
 so don't you break my heart 
 slow down, you say it in the real

 simply stated 
 hey yeah baby

 when i'm mad at all the lovebirds 
 this one ends 
 it's the only thing i know like a picture

 either way she walks by. 
 
 and i’ll tell you i'm insane

 breakin' down and the heavens fade 
 this girl is begging wait for me 
 
 don't you wonder why 
 you made me believe
