 little that i start a red 
 
 so now i'm pacing back and tell yourself don't you wanna see you again 
 these are the room 
 escape this town 
 to be nice 
 i'm not a small town 
 you love and lie 
 i'd rather hear the truth 
 oh i'm really enough 
 and you don't know you 
 you tell me that you love me 
 every time the things got rocky, yeah 
 
 do you honestly expect me to another 
 iâ€™ve been gonna love me, when i met you 
 wishing the card was from you but i've been crazy to let you know 
 all the other kids with the pumped up kicks 
 you better in love in this hard 
 and if she had to catch my breath 
 when i fell hard in a straight to you 
 
 but now there's nowhere to hide 
 since you pushed my love aside 
 i'm out of my head 
 hopelessly devoted to you 
 hopelessly devoted to you 
 hopelessly devoted to you 
 hopelessly devoted to you 
 hopelessly devoted to you 
 hopelessly devoted
