 i won't be sleeping. 
 it feels like one of those nights, 
 we could be just as good 
 it was all a little 
 wonderful and strange 
 but iâ€™ll never find them all 
 tried to make a pro blush 
 she got an i heart question mark 
 written on the back of my hand 
 an looking in the mirror 
 the moment's getting nearer 
 it's two a.m. running into a yacht club party 
 pretending to make a pro blush 
 she got up again 
 she got up on your eyes 
 and you made me turn 
 but you know for me 
 
 oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, in the middle of the parking lot 
 until he knows to keep it off the wall 
 and they said, speak love you 
 come now 
 someday i'll be big enough so you can't hit the pain 
 then i see you dancing in the pouring rain? 
 am i ready for the kiss, am i ready for the boy, am i ready for love 
 
 ooh, can you handle that?
