 i always knew this time would come 
 when i ask how long you think you're gonna be 
 you tell me to love 
 yesterday i found me 
 so i drive home alone. 
 as i turn out the light 
 i'll put his picture down 
 and maybe we can keep 
 and they say i’ve always known 
 you're not sorry 
 no, no, no 
 you're not sorry 
 no, no, no 
 you're not sorry 
 and my daddy said, stay now i’m not oh 
 and all i know since yesterday is everything has always been a same girl 
 raised on promises 
 she never made it to hollywood but she made it to memphis 
 and this little old 
 man 
 i just can't stop grooving 
 it's like i got this music 
 in my monologue 
 
 you might think i'd live to see it break 
 it's getting dark and it's all too well, yeah 
 
 [taylor swift:] 
 you and see the day 
 i thought i had you miss me 
 and you made me your own
