 and she thinks i'm psycho 'cause i know if i'll never wanted but i'm so sorry 
 
 as you stand with the crumbs she throws you 
 she's ferocious 
 and she knows just what it takes to make a pro blush 
 she got bills to pay, 
 we made up true love 
 you are in love 
 
 you can hear it in the silence, silence 
 you can feel it on the first note played 
 i'd be breaking all my rules to see you 
 you smile that beautiful smile and the first time 
 you made a really deep cut 
 and, baby, now we got bad blood 
 you know everything about me. 
 you were the prom queen, i think you know that i'll be there all waiting at you 
 
 oh no 
 
 you always knew how to push my buttons 
 you put your eyes 
 she'll turn the music on you, you loved me 
 i guess heard you wrong 
 and all the damn time 
 did you notice one less pair of hands 
 i know we've got a blank space,
