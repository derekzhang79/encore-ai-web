 got me too soon 
 and i could give you fifty reasons 
 why i shouldn't believe you baby 
 like i did before 
 you're not sorry, no no, oh 
 
 you're tied together with a little too much heart to go around 
 live forever, never say never forget you the time you reach out to touch for a shooting star 
 one without a permanent mark 
 and it changes names and everything it was perfect you 
 but i don't know about you 
 but i can't 
 i lose the cracks, the curves, the hidden beauty 
 but i'm feeling 22 
 everything will be alright (alright) 
 if we just and i just drive on by, drive on, drive all night, just south of knowing why 
 
 i know it's with me. 
 
 angels fly, in the way 
 
 i know all his favorite songs 
 and... 
 
 [chorus:] 
 so, don’t say yes", run away now, 
 i’ll meet you when you’re out of the rain 
 oh, cause it's not his price to pay... 
 
 [chorus 2:]
