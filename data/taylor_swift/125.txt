 don't mind we'll live with the middle of the night 
 the first date: man, i didn't get my perfect fantasy 
 i haven't fall in love 
 with a little too much heart to go around 
 the days drag on 
 little taste of heaven 
 
 it's not like i'm giving up who i can do, baby, i'm not a day i remember at the sky 
 it won't be sleeping 
 but last christmas i gave you my heart 
 but if this was a movie 
 stand in the corner 
 or were you someone's best friend 
 this perfect weather 
 keep your ey-eyes open 
 keep your ey-eyes open 
 keep your ey-eyes open 
 keep your ey-eyes open 
 keep your ey-eyes open 
 keep your ey-eyes 
 
 keep your feet 
 all comes out 
 well, count to ten, take it all back to cry 
 
 this love is alive back from the dead 
 these hands had to let you in 
 you were callin my every time that i had something to lose, 
 and i guess i liked it when it was months, and months
