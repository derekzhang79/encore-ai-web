 but at night you live it all up 
 so i'll never say it's time 
 
 you might be expecting me to say 
 you out clubbing but i just wanna fade 
 before 
 i was a dreamer my life are so much 
 but i still love you right 
 and i wait around that old wishing well 
 you never know if time will tell 
 i cross my heart and hope for you 
 knock on wood and rope the first note played 
 i'd be breaking all my rules 
 i used to let you choose 
 who you wanted me to be 
 yeah 
 oh, yeah 
 just like the mark you knew you caught me so 
 i don't even know where i start. 
 
 talk to the wind, talk to my friends 
 it's just another day 
 
 all my friends are saying 
 girl, what are you thinking? 
 you're better off, you're better off 
 one last blow 
 but he knows to keep it off the wall 
 
 "x" is the shape i drew through your face 
 in permanent marker
