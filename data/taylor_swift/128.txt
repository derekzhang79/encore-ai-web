 and guns

 ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
 la, la la, la 
 la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 
 la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 
 la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 
 la, la, la, la, la

 and now you're my lullaby 
 and she's been living on the street
