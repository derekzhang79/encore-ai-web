 everybody saying 
 who's that guy who plays the mandolin 
 his faith in and the heavens fade 
 this girl is begging wait, wait for me 
 
 the way you look, the way you laugh, 
 the world was from you 
 
 i've been an awful good girl, santa baby 
 so hurry down the chimney tonight 
 
 do you turn away and everything turns blue and grey? 
 and i will be 
 well, i was just thinking too years 
 
 and it was a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out 
 not knowing it will be a sweet memory 
 for you and me someday 
 
 what a shame, what a marvelous tune 
 it was all my fault 
 i had it all, i ain't too sure of 
 just two kids making up for lost love 
 
 all the walls we crashed through 
 how the kingdom lights shined just to say 
 but you'll never see, sing me to sleep 
 every night for so long, baby 
 i like the way you wanted me 
 every night for so long,
