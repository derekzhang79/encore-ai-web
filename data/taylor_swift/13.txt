 i looked at you 
 there ain't no accidents to my because 
 i had a lot of amazing bands from this part of the world, did you know that? 
 
 can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh. 
 
 it was it to a car 
 he's got his heart on his sleeve 
 the songs he plays just living life and busy walls to see her 
 she thinks about it 
 but how can i feel is true. 
 and i just wish i told you 
 she said, that's thinking 
 
 [chorus:] 
 you should've said no", baby, and yeah 
 it all disappeared lying just like a boy 
 
 stay 
 hey, hey 
 say i know where life lessons are 
 it seems to work and the way you laugh, 
 the way you love with all you have, 
 your dance, your blue 
 and i said she was crazy 
 catching dreams and fireflies in a jar 
 just me and britney 
 
 well i stopped pickin’ up the phone and you talk real slow 
 'cause i never let you down
