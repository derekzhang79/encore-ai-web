 up the look that's in your eyes 
 
 everything changed when you took me to town 
 when you think tim mcgraw 
 i hope you cry getting pain 
 am the face i out of line? 
 did to get here but it rains when you're here and just don't take up on your door 
 so here's something you should know that is for sure 
 christmas must be something more 
 
 there's gotta be more 
 there's gotta be more 
 well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me 
 merry christmas, i thought it would always been 
 
 let's talk about what you did to get here 
 let's talk about blood and sweat and tears 
 let's talk about what you did with her, 
 
 and i didn't know i've been a little too late 
 to see all these things will leave you breathless 
 or with a nasty scar 
 and iâ€™m not perfect you could say 
 i know places 
 in the dead of night, your eyes 
 the sun is going down 
 you'll be alright
