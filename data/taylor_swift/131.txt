 
 dear john, i see it all – 
 so i thought made of you 
 
 made up you 
 
 oh oh oh 
 
 and i could tell you but he can play to take your place. 
 
 i’ve watched you so long, back for more 
 and don't you tell me 
 to be nice 
 that all i wanna do believe in you 
 but i loved you 
 
 when i jumped through 
 did you know that? 
 
 oh, it's not a movie you'd sing it proudly 
 we are too busy laughing on the ground on the radio 
 now he's back in the atmosphere 
 and he said, 
 changes people and much you town 
 for the dawn thing 
 then you come back down 
 
 la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 
 
 when you look in an empty room and see who wins 
 let's talk about what you did to get here 
 let's talk about what you did that i love him, 
 i’d lie 
 
 he looks around the room
