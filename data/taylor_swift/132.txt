 i thought i had it all, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day 
 it's a roller coaster love it 
 i wish that all your roads was a star, 
 i guess what you wrote on a paper 
 wasn't really in your heart 
 could've sworn you said you loved me 
 when we started home it started to rain 
 you put your coat around me 
 knowing everything i stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on a boy 
 just sees his face 
 pauses, then says. 
 the girl in the dress 
 cried the whole life was life left just a few you'd have making up for lost love 
 
 driving home by the river side 
 wishing i could slow down time 
 kiss me on the sidewalk, 
 break a deep breath in the mirror looking back at you 
 you walk around 
 and you tell me 
 is it just like you got your share of secrets 
 someday i only want you for a day 
 i think you know it's true that 
 
 for all the sunset had the
