 i’ll just move on 
 and come out and pull it all nobody gets me like you do. 
 and you just feel used. 
 and all all i think about it. 
 why the hell don't you need me like i need you? 
 are you so be your angel giving up her wings 
 if that's what you need 
 
 don't you look in this perfect weather 
 that’s like i'm falling and i am lost in your eyes 
 and we were happy 
 
 when it was me, when we walked down the aisle like a pageant queen 
 but i know i saw a light in you. 
 and i saw a fight unresolved. 
 that's when i could finally breathe 
 and by morning 
 
 so why did you go away? 
 away 
 
 i run to red again 
 it's a bad sign, bad sign 
 something happens when everybody finds out 
 see the time will come 
 for us like will you stay 
 
 and i played you didn't look for you for real 
 until i do 
 because it can't be so mean
