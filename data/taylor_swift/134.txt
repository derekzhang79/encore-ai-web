 
 come dreams you're down to my last breath 
 trying to put on my make-up 
 so sorry, i could tell you his favorite songs 
 and... 
 
 ooh, ooh, ooh, come a little closer 
 oh, oh, i love you i love you to the moon and back 
 
 we drive and drive 
 oh, it's so painful 
 it's something that's so mad you would walk away. 
 it don't make sense to me, but: 
 
 [repeat chorus] 
 
 think i'm finally clean 
 can't have all worked out 
 but it said enough 
 you kiss on sidewalks 
 you fight to see the fallout 
 even when you're sleeping, sleeping 
 keep your ey-eyes 
 
 keep your eyes open 
 keep your ey-eyes open 
 keep your ey-eyes words 
 
 the way you love with all you have, 
 your close round 
 the wind is blowing and we're out here in plain sight 
 i can live to my face 
 but i hope you know that every time i don't 
 i almost do. 
 
 i bet it don't be in love with someone else
