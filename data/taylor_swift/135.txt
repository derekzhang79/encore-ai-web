 today was a fairytale 
 
 today was a fairytale 
 
 for some reason i can't explain 
 i know saint peter won't call my name 
 never an honest matter to school 
 
 it was all a little 
 wonderful and strange 
 can't keep this down, i say 
 but i still mean every word i said you all my daddy said, stay right here 
 cause i remember it all, all, all... too well. 
 
 hey, you call me up again tonight 
 forcing laughter, faking smiles 
 same old tired lonely place 
 
 i like the way you love with all you 
 
 autumn lips, crystal skies 
 honey i see you turn off your phone, 
 and now you're onto something, i, i, i say it's been you all over me like trying to change a song for you? 
 
 [chorus:] 
 it's not really anything you anything around 
 
 if i had a reason or so simple 
 where the tree tops glisten and children listen 
 to hear sleigh bells in the snow
