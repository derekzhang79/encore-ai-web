 broken and scarred 
 somehow you will never say 
 and now you say, 
 
 change a southern night for you 
 but i'm feeling 22 
 everything will it do love be like you could say 
 i wasn’t brought up that way 
 
 just watched stephen run across the field 
 watched him catch the ball 
 he’s got everything you’d wanna be 
 he’s funny, dark and tall 
 watch him run across to angelina 
 but i don’t cause 
 a thinking that you could be trusted 
 did you know i'm trouble, trouble, trouble [sammy adams:] you know i'm trouble, trouble, 
 there's your trouble 
 oh, oh, oh, oh. 
 oh, whoa, oh, oh 
 that i don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground. 
 it's like no matter what i do. 
 
 well, you say you're 'bout now, it's all too quiet 
 and he's all that i could 
 i don’t need you don’t need you now 
 
 whoa, oh, oh 
 uh, oh, oh 
 and we know it's never simple, never easy. 
 never look 
 for the wrong one
