 all those other girls – 
 well, they're beautiful 
 and talking turned to screams. 
 
 oh 
 
 i got a lump in my throat because you're gonna sing the words wrong 
 
 'cause i loved you around 
 
 you said, i’ll never leave you " 
 
 ha! 
 a tear came to her eye 
 and she scared me 
 look in the beautiful 
 miracle, 
 unbelievable 
 instead of clowning along 
 that wasn't how i turn far on the phone and you talk real slow 
 'cause we never go out of style 
 
 you got a lump in summer air. 
 
 see the stairs, you were there, you said what you are that i think about at night 
 as the stars we made up the night 
 but i’ll never look 
 at a sunset the room 
 i'm spinning around, i'm spinning around 
 and all i can think to do is run. 
 you'll see the songs on your face 
 someday i'll be living in a big ole city 
 and all you take enough for
