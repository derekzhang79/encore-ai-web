 trying to make it better 
 someday you come back a things 
 and all you are the best thing that’s ever been mine. 
 
 flash forward and we were happy 
 
 when it was hard to take, 
 yes, yes, this love how we got lost in translation, maybe i asked for get you 
 just thought you should know 
 
 and they they know all his favorite songs 
 
 she's standing in her bedroom 
 spelling out your name 
 spelling out your name 
 
 well maybe it’s me 
 and i lose the way 
 
 all my friends are saying 
 and i'd say 
 
 got a long list of ex-lovers 
 they'll tell you i'm insane 
 'cause when i was you and where are you? 
 and i wish i would die 
 before i met him 
 and i knew from the first note played 
 i'd be breaking all my rules 
 i used to catch you, and you 
 i always get it 
 i get what i was get this 
 
 say you'll remember me 
 can't you tell me what did
