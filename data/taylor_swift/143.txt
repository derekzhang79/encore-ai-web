 makes you feel so empty inside 
 
 but love's got me cornered in the back of the room 
 i'm spinning around, i'm spinning around 
 and all i really wanna see you hurt. 
 every little bump in the road and pray it doesn't end 
 and so when they find it like a harbor line 
 thats been a lot of lonely places 
 that i could touch 
 you go again 
 you make it look in my eyes 
 i might fall in love 
 with a little too much heart to go around 
 live forever, never say never 
 you could do better, that's what she says 
 
 mama named her drive 
 
 there's gotta be more 
 the way you kiss, the way you cry, 
 the way you move is the national anthem 
 we sing it proudly 
 we are too busy dancing 
 to get knocked off our feet 
 baby, he's so tall and handsome as hell 
 he's so close to my pictures 
 
 i never thought we'd have known it all this time 
 but i do,
