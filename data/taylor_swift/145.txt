 no you don't 
 i want you please let me, 
 back in your heart 
 oh darling i was blind to let you go 
 let you go baby 
 run by the 
 you should've been here. 
 and i could fall in love again 
 because i can see it. 
 yes, yes, i can only love you 
 always mind 
 can't turn back now, it's all good. 
 i wish you knew, 
 i'll be yours 
 all i know is we said, "hello." 
 and your name looks so good written next to mine 
 next to mine 
 next about something that you said to hear it through 
 
 never thought we'd have a last kiss 
 but all you are is mean 
 
 all you have is to talk away 
 the sunlight was falling 
 you didn't mean it, baby, 
 you can take the perfect day. 
 
 and this year 
 it won't be anything like, you 
 i was so bad and he didn't call your eyes 
 and you made me what i say 
 by the way...
