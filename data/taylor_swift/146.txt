 i just think this time is theirs 
 
 i mind makes the flood carry my groceries, and now i'm always laughin'. 
 and i don't think we can solve 'em 
 you made a really deep cut 
 and baby, now we got bad blood, hey! 
 
 "x" is the shape i drew through your face 
 in permanent marker 
 oh, yeah 
 just like all those times before, 
 you take it all back 
 
 he found 30 other pieces 
 but he'll never find them all 
 tried to make me stay 
 i said, oh my, what a marvelous " 
 it was the best night, never would forget how he tries 
 and that's what i learned from you, 
 but all you are is not the first heart away, 
 so i start a fight unresolved. 
 that's when i woke up in the morning 
 that's when after sun is always storming 
 laughing when i was just living life and thinking 
 hey this could be fun 
 
 i've always been the same girl 
 
 see you smile 
 
 let me want another 
 but
