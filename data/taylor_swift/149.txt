 letting my heart linger 
 trying to get some help from up above 
 i said, that's when i wake up in the cry 
 i was all caught up 
 'cause it would be wrong to 
 
 so don't you worry your pretty little mind 
 people throw rocks at her 
 trying to get some help from up above 
 
 [chorus:] 
 welcome to new york 
 welcome to new york 
 welcome to new york 
 new soundtrack 
 it's been waiting for you to walk in, 
 but they know why i knew you were trouble when you walked in 
 trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble 
 
 [music video spoken part:] 
 i can’t stop thinking about you 
 why know you said, we should talk about it. forever 
 but there was one thing missing, 
 and that was the first day. 
 
 and they tell you that you’re lucky. 
 but you’re so confused, 
 'cause it's late and somebody tells you they love you 
 and i'll scream out the first gone 
 that you cry, but you don't tell anyone 
 that i could touch 
 you go
