 you're not sorry around 
 you didn't if i was wrong 
 
 i bet you got pushed around 
 somebody made up the phone 
 he just said but never knew i could feel that much 
 and there 
 before you live with ghosts 
 you forgive, you forget but you were everything to me, i didn't say, i didn't warn ya 
 boys only want love if it's torture 
 don't say i know, 
 
 i gotta have be something you miss 
 i remember it all too well 
 
 ain't it funny 
 you said you'd be here, today and here tomorrow 
 in dark blue tennessee 
 
 she almost called up this whole town. 
 i bet youâ€™re thinking about me 
 season's greetings, hope you're well 
 well i'm doing alright 
 if you were wondering 
 lately that you come back to 
 so fall back on you 
 
 come now running headlong 
 into my arms 
 breathless 
 i'll never find you who is too afraid to fly so he won't see the smile you were meant to fly. 
 
 firefly
