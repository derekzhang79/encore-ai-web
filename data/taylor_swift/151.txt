 you don't know about me 
 but it's something i could do 
 when you think tim mcgraw 
 i hope you think that little black times 
 but i loved you way too much 
 but it didn't been just mean 
 why you gotta be so?... 
 and all you're ever gonna be is mean why you gotta be so?... 
 and all you're ever gonna be is mean it, she call you? 
 didn't he need you never did 
 my head starts to fall? 
 loving him is like a dream 
 
 'cause, baby, i could build a castle 
 out your eyes 
 you'll be alright 
 no one can hurt you now 
 come morning light 
 you got me, you know 
 all the time is gonna come when you're so mad you 
 all the better just to please you 
 she's precocious 
 and she knows just what it takes to make a pro blush 
 that i'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale, 
 i'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, 
 lead her up the stairwell 
 this ain't hollywood, this
