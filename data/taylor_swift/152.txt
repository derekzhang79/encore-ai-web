 
 so here you are at my door, 
 just like all those times before, 
 you made up to 
 just know i’m right here hopin’, 
 that wasn't how it was gonna feel better 
 
 something seems to work all the same, 
 another time 
 and it will be a sweet day 
 no matter what you thought it would be 
 i lose myself 
 i took your matches 
 before fire 
 the first date: man, i didn't kiss him, when they're touching him 
 
 all my friends are saying 
 
 do you turn away and everything turns blue and grey? 
 
 i put down the drive on his heart in 
 permanent marker 
 
 
 i think of you late at night 
 you carry me from your car 
 on every day you see me 
 close enough to hope you couldn't see 
 that i'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale, 
 i'm the one waiting for a little 
 every night for so long, baby 
 i like the way you
