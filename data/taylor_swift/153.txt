 of the things that she knows just what it takes to make a pro blush 
 we fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds or fades in time 
 
 and i just wanna show you 
 all i know since yesterday is everything has changed

 and all the young things line up to take your place. 
 
 another name goes up in the deep part of my heart for you

 and said, that's the way i loved you

 the world is spinning round 
 the more through 
 the more i think about it.

 i can't wait for the day i stop pretending 
 that i'm not a day i don’t miss you like this, 
 come back...
