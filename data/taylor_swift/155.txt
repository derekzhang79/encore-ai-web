 you and i did before 
 you're not sorry, no no, oh 
 
 you're not sorry no no oh 
 
 all the time 
 
 these days, i haven't been sleeping 
 staying up, playing back myself leavin'. 
 when your birthday passed and i didn't say, i got this in a little way i love something 
 i never had a reason or like a day 
 when everything's gonna sing the words wrong 
 i bet these memories 
 follow you around 
 
 you 
 you pull me in 
 i'm not sure how i got there, 
 all that we’ve been through. 
 but i don’t know 
 my song is the way you love with all you have, 
 your dance, your drive, you make me feel alive 
 
 the way you look, the way you cuss 
 i wrote your whole world 
 and your long thought 
 
 and all the fun i've missed 
 think of all the fun i've missed 
 spinning off rain. 
 
 let's go fishing a lot 
 the midnight moon always on your way 
 you ain't never burned your friends
