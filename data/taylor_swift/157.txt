 i was there when you said forever and always 
 
 was i out of line? 
 did you have to ruin what was shiny? now it's all too late so you see 
 you could've helped if you had wanted to 
 so come feel this magic i've been feeling since i met you. 
 can't my love come in a pouring rain? 
 am i ready for the boy, am i ready for the haters gonna hate 
 since you were everything to me, 
 i was there when you said forever and always 
 oh, and it kills me 
 his sister's beautiful, he has his fatherâ€™s eyes 
 keep your eyes open 
 
 everybody's waiting for you to break this 
 
 small town daydream 
 lasted all night 
 cussing out all those bright city lights 
 just look at you like the stars that shined 
 in the middle of the night 
 waking from this dream 
 it's like a million little stars, spelling out your name 
 you gotta come on, come on 
 little taste of heaven 
 
 it was all my fault
