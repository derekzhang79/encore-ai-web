 made up you 
 
 i say it's in the past, you need one 
 
 rain came pouring down when i was drowning 
 that's when i got home ... 'fore i said, "amen." 
 asking god if he could play it again

 make you fly in the air tonight 
 saying wasn't it just like swimmin' out your hands

 laughing when i was just jealous that he'd come
