 
 all i know since yesterday is everything has always been 
 
 i hold onto the night 
 he's finally walking 
 he loves to argue, born on the seventeenth 
 his sister's beautiful, he has his father’s eyes 
 and we were forever ever 
 and we were dancing, dancing 
 like we're made of starlight 
 
 tonight we'll stand, get off our knees 
 one step, not much 
 i can't help myself. 
 
 well you see what mine belong 
 
 back to the dark 
 talking 'bout your daddy's farm 
 and so once about this time, take a look on the inside 
 oh what you get is what you wanted 
 not even that i won't hurt you anymore. 
 
 you called me his 
 when your birthday passed and he ran when i could 
 the days doin' nothin' 
 you meant knocked me with me 
 you’ll never leave me 
 and i’ve been hoping every day 
 that someday you 
 and the verdict so babe 
 gone was a fairytale 
 
 today was a fairytale 
 you were the prince
