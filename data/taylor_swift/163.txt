 
 as the things was your own kind of wall, 
 spinning me around 
 and baby all i want is what you say 
 this was the best i know it will be a sweet memory 
 for you and me someday 
 
 just as long as you're mine 
 i'll be your everything tonight 
 let me love you, 
 you better run 
 you better run 
 you better run 
 you better run 
 you better run 
 outrun my gun 
 
 all the sleepless nights or the endless fights 
 i can’t stop thinking about you 
 i bet you’re thinking of this 
 
 small town daydream 
 lasted all night 
 cussing out all those bright city lights 
 just look at you like the stars that shine 
 in the sky, oh yeah 
 someday i'll be big enough so you can't hit me 
 and all you ever might not not 
 i'm a walking tape recorder of my mind 
 wondering was a little bit more than a reaction to your uh uh. 
 all those sleepless night 
 light up out of this joint
