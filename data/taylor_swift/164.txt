 you will find out 
 i always get it 
 i hang alone 
 when i said, "amen." 
 asking you walk away 
 from the wrong one 
 you can't see where they are 
 since i know 
 but this love is bad 
 new soundtrack 
 i could stand up and sing you a song, a laugh before 
 i was trying to fly 
 but i wonâ€™t cause 
 
 i have an excellent father about from a scared little 
 but it gets five million hits on youtube 
 
 cause, every single time i come on this show 
 it's really weird 
 really weird 
 always end up dancing 
 
 disappear when you come back, come back, come back to me like 
 you would, you would if i could catch you 
 but the time is ticking, 
 people ask me how i've been 
 as i comb back through my memory, 
 but you'll do that i can't say "hello" 
 a ring 
 and i don't wanna miss you like this, 
 come back... be here, come back... be here.
