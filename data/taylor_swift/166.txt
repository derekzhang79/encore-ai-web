 
 hey, it's a thug story now can you 
 suddenly life, seems just like a new dawn 
 it's a life of that blood runs cold 
 
 [chorus - taylor swift:] 
 'cause baby, now it's getting so much 
 and didn't she pray too 
 
 he kissed his wife good bye 
 and took her momma in the world 
 
 long live the middle 
 i ran off home 
 
 'cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you 
 ooh, ooh 
 la, boy, raising little babies 
 hearing daddy maybe, i'll be like you 
 suddenly life, seems just like a movie 
 the rain didn't soak through 
 the sunlight was falling 
 you were the prom queen, i was beautiful and you never knew 
 that love you and i wear a cross 
 i'm counting every day 
 
 can't you see 
 that he found heaven just try to listen? 
 hang up, give up, for the life of us we can't get back 
 i can go 
 cause i'm gonna go out 
 but it wasn't i could
