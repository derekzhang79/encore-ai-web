 and i are paintin' other people's toys 
 on the playground won't 
 make you feel so b-a-d 
 break you, make you sorry 
 i hope you cry getting my last at you 
 so why are tears pouring down when i was drowning 
 that's when i saw your face 
 pauses, then says. 
 the life is getting from those me to you, 
 'cause i say i hate 
 that you'll be here anyway 
 but you're untouchable 
 burning brighter than the rest 
 so i can see 
 
 but here in my mind comes to me, 
 something i can't get out of my head 
 i write your name i write your name 
 then i tear it all to shreds 
 
 i bet you lie 
 i'd be a game if you made time to see me like you do. 
 and there 
 wondering what to wear 
 a thing that keeps you 
 
 there is a tough crowd 
 32, and still growin' up in your eyes 
 the sun is going down 
 we could be just as suddenly 
 loving him is
