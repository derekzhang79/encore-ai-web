 it'll be one of them 
 i'm just living life and thinking 
 hey this could be fun 
 
 before you ask me if i've been going 
 oh-oh, oh-oh, oh 
 
 it would take brad pitt to leave you 
 it takes five seconds to need to feel 
 and you made a rebel of a careless man’s careful daughter. 
 she you'll only all those people that we meet 
 as we go through 
 gotta never let you down 
 we were lying on your couch 
 i remember you said, they can " 
 before you go, love you 
 wishing keeps me holding on 
 the songs he plays just living free 
 but who knows what you didn't notice 
 i hear the lines long 
 
 and i still can't wait for the day i stop caring 
 everything i know if time will tell 
 i cross my heart and hope for you 
 knock on wood and rope the moon 
 i’ll pray for you and me and hope i’m not a little girl in this little town 
 with a mess
