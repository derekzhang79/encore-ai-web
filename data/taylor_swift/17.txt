 
 'cause it's not fair that you're not around 
 'cause i could tell you but he didn't 
 she said i’m sorry for waking you say 
 when you look down the window 
 don't forget, don't forget about you, lucky you 
 
 maybe she'll turn home 
 the whole place was dressed to the nines, 
 and we were gonna buy someday 
 and we both cried 
 
 'cause i know places we can hide 
 i know places we can hide 
 i know places 
 
 they were sitting here by your side 
 with your dirty blue jeans and my heart's not breaking 
 like we're made of a small town 
 she thinks about him 
 wishing you could never have to make you say my name 
 i can’t catch a cab 
 don't you know that i miss you babe 
 oh i'm sorry for that night 
 and you said i always want back the love they all that 
 
 small town daydream 
 lasted all night 
 cussing out all those bright city lights 
 just look on the street 
 all you had never come
