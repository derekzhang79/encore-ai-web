 you can hear it in the silence, silence 
 you can feel it out somehow 
 but that i could think to do 
 where were you 
 and it ain’t you 
 and it rains in your bedroom 
 everything had to be so blind 
 when you said you needed space. (what?) 
 i’ve had known what you wanted 
 you’re the only trying in the world tonight 
 catching stars and fireflies 
 a little dirt 
 that’s the closest you’ll see me 
 feet hanging out a pickup truck 
 crazy and a little rough 
 running free 
 sitting fishing by the stairwell 
 this i only want this down, oh 
 
 and we know it's never simple, never easy. 
 never have me believing 
 i don't hate you but i can't 
 chase down the street go on? 
 doesn’t that's what we do 
 i may see 
 there are people you and it hits me up 
 i wish i could keep you, firefly 
 firefly 
 
 something so beautiful and free, 
 was as cold inside 
 i'm so in love that you act insane 
 and
