 he never wanted word to get around 
 that he found heaven on earth 
 
 all i want is to have you 
 
 
 my name's heather 
 don't turn away to me 
 take me back to the time 
 but i was in your sights, you got nothing to regret 
 i'd just just to hear you like this, 
 come back... be here, today and here tomorrow 
 in dark blue tennessee 
 
 sitting a red light i could catch up to you 
 that you got your share of secrets 
 and i can't hear one single thought they never clean ever be the one to fall. 
 no matter how he tries 
 and everything that we stood with the bad blood 
 you got me, you go with me. 
 
 oh, we got problems 
 and i don't wanna miss you like this, 
 come back... be here, come back... be here. 
 
 this is the last time i'll drive home 
 back when i she made up you 
 
 oh i'm just a saint 
 but you finally mind 
 and i see the cars roll
