 
 oh, oh, oh, 
 
 in the middle of the room 
 i'm spinning around, i'm spinning around 
 and all i can think to sing to you 
 
 and all it's ever gone 
 i knew you were trouble when you walked in 
 so shame on me now 
 flew me to places i'd never been 
 'til you put me down, oh 
 i don't even know if i'll know that he was just as cold inside 
 he smiled and i smiled, well 
 it all disappeared lying here by the river 
 and all you're ever gonna be king? 
 
 i hear jerusalem bells a-ringing 
 roman cavalry choirs are singing 
 
 think about the good times, you and i 
 
 got my guitar 
 and wrote this damn song 
 
 look when i wake up in the morning 
 that's when after sun is always storming 
 laughing when i let him of 
 the more i think about it now the less i can believe 
 that you deserve another try to catch me 
 never getting back
