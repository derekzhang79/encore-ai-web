 not his price to pay... 
 
 [chorus 2x:] 
 are we out of the woods? 
 
 looking at it now 
 it all disappeared lying here by your side 
 with your dirty blue jeans and a little dirt 
 that’s the closest you’ll see me 
 feet hanging out a pickup truck 
 crazy and a little rough 
 running free 
 that’s the closest to a cowboy 
 you’ll see me in hindsight 
 tangled of this mess. 
 it's a thug story now can you get with that? 
 
 [taylor swift:] 
 in my extra small white tee 
 
 [t-pain:] 
 straight to the top 
 
 [taylor swift:] 
 i knew you were trouble when you walked in 
 trouble, trouble, trouble 
 i love you, and don't hate you but i don’t miss you bad enough? 
 was that sure 
 and we were dancing, dancing 
 like we're made of starlight, starlight 
 like we're made of starlight 
 like we're made of a pretty brown eye 
 i'll be right here on the stage 
 and ruined my vma monologue.....
