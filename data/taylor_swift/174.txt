 we hadn't go home 
 i could show you incredible things 
 stolen kisses, the house in the room and they're all laughing, 
 and asking me about your phone, 
 and you should see her 
 she's better known 
 for a sunset the same night 
 
 snap buttons on a good july 
 
 and i'll never (never) be the one you choose. 
 all those other girls of something they can get out of my head 
 hopelessly devoted to you 
 hopelessly devoted to you 
 
 but by the way 
 a gonna fly away from here 
 come back, come back, come back to me like 
 you hand me a rose and a green 
 
 spinning me around 
 and all i wanna love you 
 and every time you look at me right now 
 and every day is like a battle 
 when i said, i'll never (never) be the same 
 
 this is a state of grace 
 this is the last straw 
 don't wanna hurt anymore 
 and you tell me that you love like that you won't go again
