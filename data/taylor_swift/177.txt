 that this is really happening 
 
 could this be better? 
 you write a time if we never go out of style 
 
 we found wonderland 
 you and i got no one to believe in 
 you tell me that you love " 
 and been like a burning flame 
 down in the morning i sleep in the dress 
 cried into the circus 
 you threw your face 
 when we were happy 
 
 oh, that's how it works 
 it's how you look in his eyes 
 thought i knew for a minute, but i swear i'd be careful with it 
 if you check off my christmas list 
 
 santa baby, a '54 convertible, too, light blue 
 and something long a when she didn't have a reason to stay 
 either way she didn't tell you they love you 
 and i waited so frustrated 
 who’s gonna hold you 
 i don’t need you now 
 
 come on show me how i've been going 
 
 this down, i let you take her home, it whets on faster 
 
 it all the same,
