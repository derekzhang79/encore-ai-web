 and it's a song one little skirt 
 and the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake 
 decides 
 but this love is ours 
 
 ooh, ooh, come a little closer 
 oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
 oh, whoa, oh, oh 
 and iâ€™m that it baby 
 i had a lot about you and i, 
 you'd run for the fences 
 
 i don't believe you baby 
 like i did before 
 you're not sorry 
 no, no, no 
 you're only one of them 
 i'm just living life to do this week 
 'cause it doesn't 
 
 [repeat chorus] 
 
 and it hits me up 
 i won't let fear clip my wings and tell me how high i can fly 
 how could i have been looking like a one of those nights 
 
 hey, hey what do you say 
 we made up our feet 
 baby, we're the new romantics 
 come on, come along with me 
 the way you love with all you have, 
 there ain't nothing bout you 
 that don't save
