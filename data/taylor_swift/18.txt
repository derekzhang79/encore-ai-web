 to see that you've been gone 
 i should go there 
 so take a deep breath as you walk through the doors. 
 and crawled on my knees through the valley of the shadow of doubt 
 then the truth are we all comes out 
 isnâ€™t life sweet? 
 
 i could be your little beauty queen 
 this is my musical monologue 
 
 and i'm not in love 
 
 it's a fight of an angel 
 a goodbye world 
 never saw it later, 
 and said, she had to know 
 could've loved you all my life, i got no one to believe in 
 you tell me that you want me 
 that you see what you're doing to me 
 
 that i know i had the best day 
 with you today 
 
 now i know we've been a bit reckless 
 and i do 
 i'll keep writing songs about you 
 
 oh i'm just a girl 
 oh i'm just a girl 
 oh i'm just a girl 
 oh i'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world 
 
 and
