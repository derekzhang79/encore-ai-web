 you and i'll be like you walk out 
 not knowing it will be a sweet memory 
 for you and me 
 fell in love when i play you said, of it 
 
 i'm sick and don't turn away now 
 and it's so wrong that all i need you now 
 
 small town daydream 
 lasted all night 
 cussing out all those bright city lights 
 just look at you now, " 
 i'll be strong, i'll be wrong, oh but life goes on 
 can i need is on the other side of town 
 with his head in his hands and she's true so my friends 
 we'll just drive down this road till the one we're on ends 
 and we'll 
 i want to be somewhere where you are 
 i want to be where... 
 
 [chorus:] 
 you belong with me. 
 
 seems like there's getting waiting at the front porch steps 
 after everything i must confess, i know 
 our song is the slamming screen door, 
 sneakin' out late, tapping on your window 
 when we're on the front porch 
 look at you
