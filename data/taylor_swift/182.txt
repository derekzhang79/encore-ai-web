 
 i couldn't ask for me 
 he never did 
 be your everything tonight 
 and i 
 watch him run across as wishing else 
 
 well, i got an i heart question mark, oh yeah 
 and i’m not perfect you could say 
 i didn't read you, at you 
 i was born free 
 i’m a cell phone hippie 
 are you with the trying to always a believed in a place in this world 
 
 in a daze, pull the shades 
 close my feet 
 come back, come back, come back to me like 
 you would, you would if it do you? 
 i wish you would feel my perfect fantasy 
 i realize you love yourself more than you could say "sabotage" 
 
 i can't hear one single night ends 
 
 when you come back down 
 
 oh, it's so girl 
 livin' in a crazy world. 
 tryin' to figure out what living like baby 
 once i drive home alone. 
 as i walk away, 
 feel the warmth 
 when we both stay, stay, stay, stay. 
 
 you touch me once
