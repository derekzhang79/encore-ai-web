 why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart? 
 
 it's a too late 
 i just realized everything you, 
 i remember waking up with you 
 all i need is on the other side of town 
 with his head in his hands and she's just 7 miles away 
 but look at you now, " 
 
 he's so bad and talking too much 
 and i'm still not bad 
 oh yeah 
 
 you'd be here 
 for a sad beautiful tragic, beautiful tragic, beautiful tragic, beautiful 
 
 all i know 
 could've loved you all my life 
 without you coming up 
 it’s like the first heart broken 
 tell her what you did it again 
 even if it's just in your 
 wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh, 
 wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh. 
 
 you could try to be better? 
 nobody ever lets me in 
 i hope you don't know how to be something you miss 
 i ain’t an old brown paper sack 
 pack it light or pack it heavy 
 take a deep breath then jump then fall into 
 wasn't it beautiful
