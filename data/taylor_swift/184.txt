 there's gotta be more 
 there's gotta be more

 hey, all the things you change 
 i remember what you tried 
 and don't hate me for loving you 
 and people like a perfect start to

 fond gestures are exchanged 
 and the sinking feeling starts, 
 as i think when it's all over,

 i just wanna open your eyes 
 and never really had a chance 
 tell them how the crowds went wild 
 we were talking – 
 i never talked about the tears i cried 
 all the sleepless nights 
 and i saw the story on the news 
 i saw the smile 
 said, i'll be sick cause it's not
