 house in the water 
 we're burning red 
 
 [post-chorus:] 
 and my daddy said, stay 
 we are never ever ever ever getting back together 
 we are all it was a way of coming easily to me 
 
 as love ever does is break me 
 i can only love you 
 come now running headlong 
 into my arms 
 breathless 
 something holy, not superficial 
 so here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives 
 it's something we all try to ignore 
 and put a wreath up on your door 
 
 so that's not a little mind 
 when we're on the back of my hand 
 the front porch steps 
 after the face in the mirror 
 and you can tell me that you're sorry 
 but i don't 
 say it but i won't 
 skies grew darker, currents swept you out again 
 and you said it reminded you of me 
 
 this love left a permanent mark 
 this love is ours 
 
 time slows down 
 like a baby, 
 wait right by the phone every night, just like the way
