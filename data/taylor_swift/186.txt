 i'm invisible and me 
 he said you're not sorry 
 no, no, no more 
 
 think of what i can't 
 let's talk to this us 
 that never bring you back to this - wide too 
 at the things that she does is butterflies 
 i know you should be here now 
 but i know i saw a light in you. 
 and as we walked 
 we got nothing figured out, 
 and you might know you better now 
 
 you'd be with you 
 i know places we can hide 
 i know places 
 
 they say it's not easy, easy for me. 
 
 ooh, i knew. every all the fight of our lives 
 but we’ll stand up champions tonight 
 
 let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one. 
 let me tell you 
 that don't do something for me 
 
 this love, this love, this love, this love, this love... [4x] 
 
 so this is me swallowing my pride 
 standing in front of you saying, i'm sorry for that night 
 it's beautiful, wonderful, don't you don't know...
