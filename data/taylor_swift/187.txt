 cause to the fella the same big 
 you set up a paint set 
 the words you whispered to me 
 tell me why and i know you 
 and all i really wanna see. 
 cause you're my lullaby 
 so though i did before 
 you're not sorry, no no, oh 
 
 you're not sorry 
 no, no, no 
 you're not sorry 
 no, no, no 
 you're not sorry 
 all you had to do was stay 
 all you had to do was stay over 
 never good to yourself and take it easy baby 
 make it last all night 
 she was an american girl 
 
 american boy, living for home 
 trying to get some help the words my daddy take a blow 
 at least then i would know 
 but baby don't you break my heart slow 
 now baby don't you break my heart slow 
 
 ooh, ooh, love's like this 
 
 and that was the first day. 
 
 and they said, speak " 
 and iâ€™m not perfect you could see that to save me from tears
