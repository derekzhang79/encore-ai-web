 right right now, it's all good. 
 i wish you knew, 
 so i'll just forget that you never did 
 take a deep breath as you walk through the doors. with your cheeks watch you sleep 
 just know you see what you're doing to me and my baby 
 the car pulls up and i'm home 
 
 waiting for the words 
 i think you know it's wrong 
 i know it will be a sweet memory 
 for you and me someday 
 
 what do you say? 
 what do you say? 
 
 what do you say? 
 that cuts me to the core 
 where is this going? 
 thought i knew 
 love is different 
 but you know you only get one 
 or i found you bad enough? 
 was there some reason i'm not aware of? 
 did you not write a damn song 
 for the life of us we can't get back 
 i had to, 
 
 wake up and smell the break-up, 
 realize that we could never leave her 
 i never talked that hear you coming undone
