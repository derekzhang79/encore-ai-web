 he thought it's wrong 
 you're all i wanted at just out 
 and you were country one chance 
 wish you're on my pain 
 and i could tell you now but never mind 
 and i was there when you wanted to 
 it wasn't just like a ghost 
 but just, baby, could see you his favorite color's green 
 he loves to argue, born on the seventeenth 
 his sister's beautiful, he has his fatherâ€™s eyes 
 and you and that yours every time is the best of me 
 so i tuck you forever and i try to grab at the fray 
 now he knows to keep it off the wall 
 i always knew this time 
 did you notice that you're sorry 
 but i can't believe you better, know you better and never 
 and think of you late at night 
 i hope you cry getting my r-e-v-e-n-g-e 
 
 so i'm close your face 
 to be messed with? 
 the secrets or my deepest fears. 
 through it all the beautiful times 
 we found wonderland 
 you and i saw the story
