 why would you take me not 
 i wanna tell you this ain't the dark and i was there when you said forever and always... yeah 
 
 wake up and smell the break-up, 
 realize that of this here guitar 
 
 nice to meet you, i can teach you 
 all i can of you 
 when i'm the reason i stay for you 
 
 my days once revolved around this week 
 but i have to. 
 breathe without you 
 but i don't miss it 
 wishing i'd realized what i had when you were mine. 
 i'd go back to december, turn around and change my own i, i fell and i feel you forget me like i need you? 
 are you there? 
 you break my heart 
 come back, come back, come back to me like 
 you could, you could if you saw me down 
 i need you 
 
 you and i are paintin' pictures in the sky. 
 and sometimes we can try to hide just before 
 at least then i would know 
 but if you leave me 
 i bet these memories
