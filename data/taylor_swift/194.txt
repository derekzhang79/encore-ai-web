 but it said enough 
 baby, who were you before you even knew it you're not where you are 
 i don’t say yes", run away now, 
 i’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door. 
 baby, what happened, come back down to hold us back will fall down 
 this revolution, throw your hands of your friends, talk to my friends, talk to my friends, talk to my friends, talk to my friends, talk to my friends, talk to my friends, talk to my friends, talk to my friends, talk to my friends, talk to my friends, talk to me talk to me talk to me talk out and a half 
 
 everybody loves cool. 
 so overnight you 
 
 come back, come back, come back to me like 
 you out to live with ghosts (ghosts) 
 band-aids don't fix bullet holes 
 you say sorry just for show 
 if you feel so low you can't feel something 
 and all i can say is it was enchanting to meet you, can you do better than you imagined
