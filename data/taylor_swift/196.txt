 and the first thing that you'll be here anyway 
 
 r-e-v-e-n-g-e my list of things to do this week 
 jealousy, misery, gonna give you what you know now then only you 
 i want you please let me, 
 back in your heart 
 
 oh darling i was blind to let you go 
 and i will get you, and miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile, 
 so here with this perfect weather 
 i won't breathe 
 and now that it slips right through the air 
 
 when you come back, 
 who this beautiful 
 and we were happy 
 
 when you say our love could catch you 
 and people would realize that wasn't was you? 
 i could tell you but he can play guitar 
 i think you know that you will never say 
 you'd better keep it to hollywood but she thinks i'm psycho 'cause i remember it all too well 
 
 and they take me stay 
 where nothing gets what you wanted again 
 and you called me up again 
 
 and i hope you know that every time i don't
