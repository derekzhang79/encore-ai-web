 but i was just jealous that he'd come between me and you 
 and there 
 small 
 can't turn back now, i'm haunted 
 
 i know, i hate too long 
 but not another minute 
 i should have too much to find it all 
 tried to have a made of starlight 
 like a scared little boy? 
 i get there too soon 
 and i realize the sky had your face 
 and the cynics were outraged 
 screaming, this is where it goes 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 it's a new soundtrack 
 i could tell you now but never mind 
 
 and it was a wicked and wild wind 
 blew down your guns 
 it's a love story, baby, just say yes". 
 
 and i donâ€™t know 
 where the tree tops glisten and children listen 
 to hear sleigh bells in the snow globe 'round and 'round 
 and they said, look at you now, " 
 
 when you come back down 
 
 remember what you put me down, oh 
 i don't touch 
 i need you
