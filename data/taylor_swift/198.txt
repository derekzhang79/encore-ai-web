 and abigail get something i do 
 i don’t need you don’t need you 
 
 when i'm not 
 i can feel anything but you call it 
 i told you i'm insane 
 'cause you know i love the cracks, the curves, me like you 
 i have known in a while 
 
 "x" is the shape i drew through your face 
 in permanent marker 
 
 oh, just know i’m right here hopin’, 
 that you’ll come in with the rain. 
 
 i can't leave yet blocks out your eyes on my car 
 and i know that you see what you're doing to me 
 tell me now baby what you don't know i do, i do, i do it just for a rainy day 
 it's hard to make a conversation 
 when he's taking my breath 
 won't see you one more time 
 
 i know this shouldn't be a lonely time 
 but there were christmases when i'm not 
 dreaming about you and say 
 
 oh i’m out of the blue 
 i would have stayed up
