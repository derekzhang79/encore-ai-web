 
 but it doesn't 
 
 [repeat chorus] 
 
 so when the blind was one block wide way 
 i love each freckle on your face, a knife 
 waiting at you 
 and i’ll leave my window open, 
 ‘cause i’m too tired at night for all these games. 
 just know i’m right here hopin’, 
 that you’ll come in with the sky, 
 talk to the man who put you here, 
 so turn that car around 
 
 ooh, i'm just walking 
 trying to see through the rain 
 and i almost do. 
 
 i bet just you for that " 
 and i could be your favorite blue jeans 
 and i'm sitting here by the river car 
 got my guitar 
 and wrote this damn song 
 
 look what you've found 
 she's been in and out of hospital 
 since it all right. 
 we are never getting back together 
 
 you might have him but i always know 
 so may your days be merry and bright 
 and they said, speak " 
 and i'm only me when i'm with you. 
 
 [chorus:]
