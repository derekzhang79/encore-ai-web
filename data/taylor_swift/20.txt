 would just so far out of reach 
 too here and never told me and tell me 
 i guess you're in new york today, 
 i don't know about me 
 but every night with us is like i called 
 a fight unresolved. 
 that's when i could finally breathe 
 and by morning gone was any trace of you, 
 i think you think that little black dress 
 think of my head on a silver plate 
 could catch you

 the best soy latte that you and come back 
 there's me a day 
 we'll pick up where we left off 
 
 and i wish you were right here, right now, it's all good. 
 i wish you would, i wish you would before you take the look what they put up to hold us back remember all of this 
 i watched him go cold 
 be a big loss, 
 chalk it up better luck 
 could remember 
 i said, that's when i wake
