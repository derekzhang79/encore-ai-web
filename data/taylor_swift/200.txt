 but you come out of the blue 
 i wanna tell you why 
 but somehow i know 
 i wanna be your left hand man 
 i love you 
 come now running headlong 
 into my arms 
 breathless 
 
 lay down your guns 
 too weak to run 
 nothing can harm you here 
 out of focus, eye to eye 
 recalling words we said and the way you want her 
 but you pull me in and i'm a little more brave 
 it's the first kiss, 
 sometimes i get temperamental 
 
 but here i am in the middle of the night 
 when i'm out up this town 
 but i ready for the joy, am i ready for you 
 welcome to new york 
 
 it's a new soundtrack 
 i could dance to from a storm in my best dress 
 sure had a good time 
 cleaning up that mess 
 
 hey stephen, 
 i could give you up but it's like a million little stars 
 spelling out your name 
 you gotta come on, come on 
 find yourself another 
 hey, all
