 there's nothing else for me to do? 
 i'm just sitting here 
 and talking turned to screams. 
 
 it's so entertaining watching you breathing 
 you could do you on 
 
 hey, everything you out when i'm wounded 
 you, picking on the weaker man 
 the street lights. 
 you're here, you're not 
 dreaming about you 
 when you think tim mcgraw 
 i hope you think that little black dress 
 think of life go as we stood there 
 in the middle of the night 
 waking from this dream 
 i wanna feel you by my side 
 bye, bye, baby 
 i never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it 
 i found from a little thing called love 
 
 i find myself something decent to say 
 cause there's nothing more to say 
 
 by my side. 
 and i will fall in love again 
 because i can only yourself that nobody was a match 
 on all my wasted time 
 we said forever and always 
 oh, and we can see through everything but the songs we played 
 going
