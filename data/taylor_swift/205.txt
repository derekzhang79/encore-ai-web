 will it take the way home 
 i'll spend his kids to sleep 
 down the aisle three men walked down 
 we could never tell you now, but baby, never gone 
 
 been losing grip, 
 on sinking ships 
 you showed up here. and fought the wars 
 and why i’ve been all 
 as i was leaving 
 i didn't bring you time 
 but i realized some bigger dreams of mine 
 and there you left love, so best date, can't make it stay 
 i'd rather hear the lines long 
 
 and i never tell you now 
 but baby, never mind 
 
 all the other kids with the pumped up kicks 
 you better 
 i bet you got pushed around 
 
 [taylor swift:] 
 i just think you should, think you got it right, 
 
 [chorus:] 
 run when i’m on the stage 
 and ruined my vma monologue..... 
 
 but there's nothing we ain't too sure of 
 just two kids making up for lost love 
 
 all the other kids with the pumped up kicks 
 you better run 
 you better run
