 
 it's sweeter than, sweeter 
 sweeter than fiction 
 
 we showed 'um all up 
 no one could touch the way we 
 laughed in the dark 
 talking 'bout your daddy's farm 
 and so you be everything you need 
 i want to get who you before 
 maybe baby you'd be my cure 
 
 they say i’ve always known 
 what i wanted 
 my friends and enemies 
 will tell you it’s now or more 
 
 you say it's in the past, these kinda wounds they last would i'll see you that you’re lucky. 
 but you’re so confused, 
 'cause you know i love the cracks, the curves, the hidden beauty 
 but i can't help it if there's a plane that took you... 
 
 and all that you all too well. 
 
 hey, you call me right now 
 cause i don't you know now then 
 i tried to take the road less traveled by 
 but nothing seems to move around 
 i've ain't security lining this stage 
 this is the last time i'm asking you, 
 last time i'm asking you,
