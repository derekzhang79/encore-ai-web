 i want to be where... 
 
 [chorus:] 
 you're not gone. you can't hear it out 
 i'm not all that we’ve been through. 
 she’s never getting back together 
 
 like, ever... 
 
 i'm really gonna tell you how the fire went out 
 sorry for the inconvenience, i didn't mean 
 if i gave you space 
 you say you're so much 
 and i forget about you long enough 
 who gave you 
 my love 
 
 baby, i know places we made quite a mess, babe. 
 it's probably better off my feet 
 the closer that we get 
 oh, i should sing that you could be trusted 
 did you know i'm trouble when you walked in 
 trouble, trouble, trouble 
 i just don't know i always tell 
 that all your sweet smile, 
 so good to hear your laugh 
 i think that it's best dropped it proudly 
 we are too busy dancing 
 to get knocked off our feet 
 baby, i'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake 
 i shake it off, i shake
