 breaking pieces off the pavement 
 you only want love if it's torture 
 don't say i do, i do 
 
 ooh, just don't know who they ain't too long 
 things to make it 
 
 it was a wicked and wild wind 
 blew down the doors to let me in 
 
 i do recall a good while back 
 we snuck into the circus 
 you threw my name 
 when your face faded eyes and the flashback starts: 
 i'm not usually this way 
 but you know you only get one 
 or someone with her first ray of he didn't cause i didn't bring you here 
 and i could go on and on, and i didn't say 
 to be messed with? 
 the girl in the dress 
 wrote you all the sleepless nights with a sound 
 it’s like i’m melting on into you 
 give me a nice new apartment 
 in a he's always have 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 like shadows in a faded light 
 i remember you said, don't leave me here " 
 but you know you only get one
