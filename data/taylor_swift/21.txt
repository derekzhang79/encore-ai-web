 come on baby and i had you in the palm up in a pretty brown eye 
 i almost always liked it in all my wasted time 
 as i think in songs so don't you walk with your hands 
 i look around, turn the radio down 
 we play dumb but we know everything 
 trying to get along 
 forever going with the flow, 
 but you're coming undone 
 he can see through everything but baby, now you're gone 
 i was there when it said forever and " 
 
 [4x] 
 and that's how it took me away. 
 you look like an angel, 
 can't help it if there's no one else. 
 mmm, i can't wait for the love 
 
 i remember......... 
 
 you can tell me when i come back, 
 wish i never hung up that way now 
 
 a long time going 
 
 they say it's better you won't have to think twice 
 she's pure as new york snow, she got bette davis eyes 
 she'll turn the music on you, roll you like you were dice 
 until you come up blue,
