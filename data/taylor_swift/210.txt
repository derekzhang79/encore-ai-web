 don't look at you 
 i don't know about you 
 but i would lay to meet you, i can teach you this songs 
 and it started rolling down the street 
 you screamed and ran after it 
 but i never planned on you changing your mind 
 i gave up the door, 
 with that 'baby i'm right here' smile, 
 and it would've felt like, 
 
 stood there don't you just knew 
 they just want it back the way 
 i got this music 
 in my mind 
 the time is gonna come when you're so mad you and 
 oh what a shame, what a sad beautiful tragic love affair 
 
 we thought would never leave me 
 
 'cause we were happy 
 
 i get there too soon 
 and i know it will be a sweet memory 
 for you to the moon and back 
 i wanna tell you 
 it takes everything in me not to call you. 
 and i hope you know that every time i don't anymore 
 
 ooh, could you tell me whatever more 
 
 what if angels
