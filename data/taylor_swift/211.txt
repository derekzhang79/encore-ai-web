 we had all waiting on the front porch 
 talking about love and how it changes things 
 changes things 
 changes people and it changes names and everything but me and britney 
 
 oh, oh you tell me why 
 i'm feeling like i don't know how to be something you miss 
 just like the ones i used to know 
 so bad 
 but don't you walk on your that's when i got my heart broken 
 think of all the fun i've missed 
 think of all your roads at your window 
 i mind right in front of you, i tell you i miss anymore 
 ooh, ooh, come a little closer 
 oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
 and they tell me about you 
 can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone conversation 
 the best soy latte that my time 
 
 i put down the misletoe 
 next and i'm so mad i might tell you that it's over 
 but if you this way, 
 come back... be here, come back... be here. 
 i guess it's true that love was all you wanted
