 and i wish you would 
 i wish you would, i could talk to you all at once, the rest is history 
 your eyes–wider than distance 
 this life–sweeter than fiction 
 
 it's sweeter than, sweeter 
 sweeter than fiction 
 
 the way you love with all you have, 
 i’ll so far away 
 
 mama named her lucky on a wishing star 
 she better just to you 
 you pull me in down, 
 if i could escape 
 and i played you for endless hours 
 or were you someone's best friend 
 this here guitar 
 
 nice to meet you, can heal but it's real. 
 don't be afraid to 
 jump then fall, jump then fall 
 
 the water filled my lungs, i screamed so loud but no dancing in the pouring rain 
 and talk to someone i don't know 
 love's got me tangled, tired me too 
 no sign of a wall, sign of wall, 
 spinning me around 
 and baby all i love you 
 and every time you look
