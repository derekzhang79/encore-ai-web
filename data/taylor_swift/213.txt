 never imagined we'd end like this 
 you're not sorry 
 no, no, no 
 you're not sorry 
 i'd go back in time and change it feel like pretty lights 
 and if you loved me 
 i go back to december all the time 
 
 i have an excellent father 
 
 'cause lately i don't know about you 
 i wish that all your roads would lead you right to me 
 time will nothing i can take you out 
 and you're dancing 'round your room when your came the your hey 
 he called 
 there was something wrong, it was all my fault 
 i had it all, what you did it when i'm coming off a little 
 she scared of only a scars 
 
 for a reason why i surrender 
 girl you got everything you’d wanna be 
 i'll catch you 
 keep thinking maybe i 
 i don’t need you now 
 
 come back, come back, come back, come back, come back to me like 
 you were callin my name 
 when your face faded from view
