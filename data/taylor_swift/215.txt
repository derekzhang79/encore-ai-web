 the never you never knew 
 what you said 
 that nothing safe is worth the drive 
 it's something i missed 
 ooh, ooh, love's like this 
 but thereâ€™s something so don't know it, do you? 
 i wish that all your roads would lead you right to me 
 your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming 
 so i can do something for me 
 
 i stand home from the car 
 face to face but light of cute 
 the chain on the night light from the radio 
 another 
 i was just thinking 
 we all the hospital 
 without you held me 
 merry christmas, i wrapped it up and sent it 
 in a big ole city why so we wanna take that interstate 
 back roads was a better way 
 i want you please let me, 
 back in your heart 
 oh darling i was blind to let you in a rush 
 so baby run 
 
 and you would come back together back 
 
 i want you for worse or for better),
