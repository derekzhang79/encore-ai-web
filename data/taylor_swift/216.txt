 have ten kids and teach you 
 all i hate you you won't give me one first 
 who understands you? 
 been here all along. 
 so, why can't you see 
 there's nothing else for me to do? 
 i'm just sitting here to die for our love or take my eyes off of you 
 lay low iâ€™m a mission rebel 
 
 but i got an picture of you, i'm telling you 
 
 we drive around town in a rusty old truck 
 somehow it feels like we're flying 
 don't give me choices 
 and that's what they can't leave 'cause this year 
 it won't be easy but i can't breathe without you 
 but i never planned on you changing your mind 
 
 i had it all, what a shame, what a fall now 
 but in case 
 i can feel by from their applause 
 remember how you are 
 and you know i only want you forever and " 
 
 [4x] 
 and that's how it took me away. 
 you say that you found me, you found me 
 i guess
