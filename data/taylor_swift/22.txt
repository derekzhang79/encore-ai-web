 
 keep your feet ready 
 heartbeat steady 
 keep your eyes open 
 
 say it or shake it 
 i wish that all your roads would lead you right to me 
 don’t fight me a hundred thousand times 
 
 maybe if you saw me down that road 
 and it would take brad pitt to leave you like it's as you're mine 
 i'll be your everything 
 
 if you could come all where i've been there 
 
 tell me,oh 
 you’ll always need me like that 
 
 it's not bad about the liars and the dirty, dirty cheats of the top drawer 
 i could be your little beauty queen 
 just a little outta reach 
 or the girl in the dress 
 cried the whole way home 
 
 i said all this playing 
 did you need from me 
 tell me to what you are 
 
 every single time and it all leads to this - our life thought i really just 
 every kiss you 
 
 this night is flawless, don't you let it all " 
 i don't feel welcome anymore 
 baby,
