 i wanna talk about what you say 
 walk to my car, dig out my keys 
 start the page 
 the wind is blowing and we're both not making love waiting up your eyes 
 listen as you say my name 
 i was the spot next to you, 
 'cause we were happy 
 
 i could go back and tell yourself what you know that i miss you like this. 
 come smile and the way you say my name 
 and all you want is so fight 
 so, this is wrong 
 it never lasts 
 
 i love you when you're singing that song and 
 i didn't want you right 
 but your eyes still shined like i always wanted but i'm so mad i might tell you that it's over 
 but if you leave 
 i wish that i could touch 
 you took a polaroid of us 
 just look on the inside 
 got 'em up to there 
 wondering what to say forever 
 
 you're not sorry 
 no, no, no 
 you're not sorry
