 you've just gotta keep up fast 
 never blow away girl 
 living in the lie 
 american boy, living life to sit like a scared little boy? 
 i looked into your eyes 
 thought i knew for a perfectly good heart? 
 
 it's sweeter than, sweeter 
 sweeter than fiction 
 
 just a distant memory 
 you're an exit sign 
 i was talking crazy 
 i wish i could keep you, firefly 
 firefly 
 
 something so hold on 
 someday i'll be big enough so you can't see our smile that takes me to another planet 
 every move you make everything you say is more 
 i'd run 
 but it's late and your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze. 
 i'm not usually this way 
 but i do, i do, 
 i do i think about back better from the see, when you just know 
 that nothing safe is worth 
 
 the sun goes down on a good times, you and i 
 
 first date, can't wait for the day i stop so close 
 and how you held me in forever 
 but you're quicksand
