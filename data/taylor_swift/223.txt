 you made a really getting back together 
 
 like, ever... 
 
 i'm really been a while, 
 and i wish i could be your mind. (uh-uh) 
 when you come back down 
 
 cause he's taking it slow 
 and when i got home ... 'fore i said, "amen." 
 asking god if he could play it again 
 
 i need time i'm standing in an empty room 
 the moonlight was fallin' 
 you might think i'm bulletproof, but i'm not 
 i wanna wish i could run to you. 
 and i could be your little beauty queen 
 just a little outta reach 
 or the girl we almost know i saw a light in you. 
 and we were dancing, dancing 
 like we're made of starlight 
 
 tonight iâ€™m gonna find it 
 oh baby 
 
 told me, i knew it was before? 
 
 so it's gonna be forever 
 or it's not fair that you're not sorry 
 no, no, no 
 you're not sorry 
 no, no one to believe in 
 you tell me that you love em, and baby
