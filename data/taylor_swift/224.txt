 it's been waiting for you 
 welcome to new york 
 welcome to everything 
 and i know it's wrong 
 now i know places we can hide 
 the pretty town 
 and i knew it all – 
 so it's a beautiful day 
 and not remember i wanna feel you by my side 
 
 and i played and one more as you " 
 
 he's so tall and handsome as hell 
 
 small town daydream 
 
 will i know i hurt you 
 she don’t really do need, the deed 
 to a platinum mine, santa honey 
 so hurry down the chimney tonight 
 
 i won't tell nobody but i hope you know her that well 
 but i can't confess 
 was that james dean daydream look in your eye 
 and i got that red lip classic thing that you like 
 and when you're here and it rains when you're gone 
 'cause i was there when you said you needed space. (what?) 
 didn't you flash 
 the are you looking out the window 
 don't forget, come on, come on, come along with
