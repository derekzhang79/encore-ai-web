 come help this your 
 oh i'll be waiting at the front gate 
 that's when i woke up so sweet 
 stay just a girl on a mission 
 oh i'm alone, on a good day 
 tomorrow is still an unknown 
 you i knew. 
 ooh, just even look at you 
 and i can think to do 
 is follow you 
 
 this is when the feeling sinks in, 
 i don't wanna think about that right now 
 cause everything i want is miles 
 but something 'bout your friends 
 and if you come around 
 i'm counting together 
 a thousand smiles 
 now i still can't see, 
 i've got an i heart question heard of see you one more time 
 to give me what you wanna be with me, so baby 
 
 don't know how and feel those headlights 
 but don't you tell me 
 you're not sorry 
 no, no, no 
 you're not sorry 
 no, no, no 
 you're not sorry 
 all you had to do was stay 
 all you had to do things seen you here 
 come on baby
