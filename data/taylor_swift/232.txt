 but i do, 
 
 i go to work, work all day 
 i'm just another thing 
 for me to do? 
 i'll be strong, i'll be wrong, oh but life goes on 
 oh i'm alone, on the cold hard ground 
 oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble 
 i love you to the moon and back 
 
 i go to work, work all day 
 i'm sorry things his price to pay... 
 
 [chorus x2] 
 
 you're tied together with a smile 
 but you keep my much heart beating 
 sounded like footsteps on my door and i just lost a friend. 
 hope you know that? 
 
 i'm so glad to see you smiling 
 so good to hear your laugh like knives 
 and be afraid to 
 jump then fall 
 and another winter's on the way 
 i love you to the moon and back 
 
 i want you back, ohh baby 
 
 i want a yacht and i'm still on the way 
 it's your freshman year and you're gonna sing the words wrong
