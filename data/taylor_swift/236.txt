 back up, but i know you wish it was me, 
 if you leave i'll be crawling back for more 
 and if you ever leave i'll be crawling back for more 
 and if you ever need love i'll be standing at your door 
 i'll show you that i don't let go 
 we are alone with our changing minds 
 we fall through the valley 
 tearing up a good july 
 
 could do you do, when he's next to you 
 but you got lost in it 
 and life was never worse but never better 
 eh eh 
 
 eh [5x] 
 in wonderland 
 
 i reached for you but you know the joke is on me, yeah! 
 
 i met bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45 
 picked me up late one night out the window, 
 i hear the lines long 
 
 and don't hate you baby 
 keep thinking maybe i 
 i wish you would 
 
 you're not sorry 
 no, no, no 
 you're not sorry 
 no, no, no 
 you're not sorry 
 i'd be 
 
 [chorus]
