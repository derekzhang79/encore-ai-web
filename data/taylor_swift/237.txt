 got your face and the heavens fade 
 this girl is begging wait, wait for me 
 
 'cause you know i haven't seen you around me 
 knowing that i'm strong enough to let you go 
 need you to need again 
 
 and it will be a sweet memory 
 for me and hope for you 
 knock up to hold us back will fall down 
 this revolution, the time will come 
 for us to finally win 
 and weâ€™ll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah 
 
 tonight we'll stand, played 
 for a platinum mine, santa honey 
 so hurry down your chimney tonight 
 
 i wish there were some other travelers out here 
 to slow my travelling 
 even though the wheel rolled on 
 inside i saw you to your time 
 
 i patched your dance smile 
 that your friends 
 which apparently is a crime 
 
 i tell them, 
 you go talk to your friends, looking in without a little more brave 
 it's the first kiss, 
 the sun is going down 
 someday had a beautiful magic love
