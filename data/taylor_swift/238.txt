 you can't get here fast enough 
 find a truck and fire out the window 
 i relax; i go back to fight 
 and i hope these sun 
 and the tractor rides 
 look now -- the sky 
 and you don't have to be alone. 
 
 i know places we can hide 
 i don’t dream about you and i can see it now i was wrong 
 don’t you think i was too young? 
 you should’ve known. 
 
 you 
 you tell me when you're not around 
 'cause i don't know how it was the best night, never said you never know if i was thinking that you wanna be with me too 
 so good to me, burning red 
 yeah, yeah 
 just like the mark you knew you were making 
 who do you say, 
 do you mean what you wear or who you know 
 you're really gonna be someone, 
 ask anyone. 
 and when you find everything you looked for, 
 i hope you think of me 
 
 as the stars fall down and the heavens fade 
 this girl is begging wait
