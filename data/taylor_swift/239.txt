 wishing i could slow down 
 all alone to you and the wind, talk to the tears, 
 talk to the tears, 
 talk to the man with the reasons why, 
 just be alright 
 cause i'm not the first to cry 
 i love you when you're singing that song and i don't wanna turn around 
 coz i'm not scared 
 of what love gave me and took away 
 and i need you now 
 and i just know you got a lying feel where i'd been 
 'cause i'd seen the sky 
 and you don't know, can you be there? 
 
 i don't wanna miss you like it's killing me 
 they call your eye 
 and we caught onto something 
 i hold your mind 
 she should keep in mind 
 she should keep in mind 
 she should keep in mind 
 there is nothing i do better to move apart, me, 
 i'm not usually this way before 
 i'm not trying to show maturity 
 
 to talk, walk, think, stop 
 anytime you want me to 
 bend all my rules
