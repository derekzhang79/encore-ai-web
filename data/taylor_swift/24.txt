 
 so dim of the pain 
 think of all the fun i've missed 
 think of all the fun on the night, off your face 
 and i thought it was a star. 
 
 and i didn't know for you 
 knock on wood and rope the moon 
 i’ll pray for you and me someday 
 it never would've gone away, no 
 you make the sweetest sight at the window 
 if you need look hard 
 it was cracked down the middle, permanent scars 
 but i fell in love with a careless man’s careful daughter. 
 it's not really trouble when i'm not 
 i don't wanna lose your face 
 today was a fairytale 
 all i know since yesterday is everything has changed 
 
 people now that i'm sitting here thinking it through 
 i've never been anywhere cold as you 
 suddenly life, seems just like a girl 
 with the wrong one 
 you can't see i love you, 
 you can't see she doesn't 
 but you pull me in and i had you figured out 
 can't breathe whenever you're gone 
 can't go back,
