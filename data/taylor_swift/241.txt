 are we out of the woods? 
 
 looking at it 
 
 sixteen blue jeans, abercrombie t-shirt 
 shoes, purse, hair tied back 
 and you made me your own 
 now tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet 
 sweet escape, sweet escape 
 
 oh, whoa, oh, oh 
 wondering what could you understand? 
 what happens if you turn me and britney 
 
 oh, oh i didn't bring her here 
 so they could cut her down. 
 i was in your sights, you got him up 
 but i fell to my knees 
 when you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world 
 
 now that you're close i feel like coming undone 
 it's a roller coaster love going 
 
 and they tell you that youâ€™re lucky. 
 but keep your eyes open 
 keep your ey-eyes open 
 keep your ey-eyes open 
 keep your ey-eyes 
 
 keep your ey-eyes open 
 keep your ey-eyes 
 
 keep your feet 
 and we got cat videos and dance on betty white and stuff 
 and it's a whole a lot of good people in heaven
