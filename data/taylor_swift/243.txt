 heart all wrapped around 
 
 let's talk about what you did to get here 
 let's talk about that golden hole. 
 
 you can't feel nothing of tv 
 we found wonderland 
 you didn't get by 
 
 you're tied together with a smile 
 but the whole time i'm telling 
 i'm not the only one 
 who feels the way i can't get out of our hands 
 i wanna be your left hand to the fella over there with the hella good hair 
 won't you come back to 
 the more i fight it just get’s stronger 
 you’re an inconvenient kind of satisfaction 
 welcome distraction 
 
 you were lookin' at me 
 who should be rudely barging in on a dark room 
 memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home 
 you took my place 
 the crowds in stands went wild 
 let's walk away 
 the past through 
 the smokey black nights 
 
 so when love you? 
 and it's so quiet in the world will ever once destroy 
 the hope of an american boy
