 and all i can think to do 
 is follow you 
 
 you can talk forever, if you just said you're sorry 
 i know the passwords to your emails, everything you do 
 i was crawling home 
 well, it's a run around 
 and he ran so sweet 
 and living and learning 
 i keep up with you 
 i know places we could work 
 but i know i saw a light in you. 
 and the note that said,.. 
 
 [chorus:] 
 you could see it with the lights out, lights out 
 you are in love, true love 
 it's too late to be brand new 
 
 it's time that we walked 
 we were talking â€“ 
 i remember you said, don't leave tonight 
 oh let me down slowly 
 i wish i could run to you. 
 and i keep up with you 
 i can only love you 
 come now running headlong 
 into my arms that september night 
 the first time you can't see me like that blood runs to say 
 the only thing that keeps me wishing every night with
