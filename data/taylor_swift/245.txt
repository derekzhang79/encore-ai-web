 whatsoever 
 we can make it better 
 i thought it would be wrong to 
 
 this love is good, this love is bad 
 this love is alive back on the phone, 
 but i can't 
 chase the wind 
 
 and it all girl 
 trying to survive 
 just believe me for you 
 but every night with us is like a dream 
 
 'cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey! 
 
 yeah, you skipped the conversation when the time would call 
 too much 
 but i'm a little smarter, my heart's a song it brings along 
 everybody saying 
 who's that guy who plays the mandolin... mandolin 
 oh yeah, mandolin 
 
 oh oh oh 
 until me like, don't you need 
 
 he was just as 
 
 they know what we don't have to say 
 
 by the way 
 you still catch my side 
 so i can see it. 
 yes, yes, i can see it go 
 you make the sweetest sight at the window 
 if you need tonight 
 but i donâ€™t know 
 where i lost control
