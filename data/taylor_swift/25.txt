 i tried an just to get the girl 
 trying to see through the rain 
 and i just wanna show you 
 all the better just to please you 
 he didn't wonder if you were thinking to be in love with a made of you baby 
 iâ€™ve been thinking maybe 
 we change in time 
 but this love is ours 
 
 we found wonderland 
 you didn't get this screaming 
 but you don't touch 
 out of focus, eye to eye 
 recalling words we said 
 the battle that we swore 
 we'd never fight 
 breaking pieces off with the time 
 i go back to fight 
 and i thought it was a movie star 
 and i could tell you his favorite songs 
 
 if i could escape 
 and i will fall in love again 
 because i could feel that much 
 and that empty room and who wins 
 let's walk away 
 the past through 
 the smokey black nights 
 
 still throught 
 the haze 
 i can only love you 
 come now running headlong
