 you said it doesn't work out, 
 nothing in the world together, 
 and there’s a drawer of you? 
 and you tell me about your dreams. 
 on a history book page 
 it all disappeared lying here by your side 
 with your dirty blue jeans 
 with the one year and said cornered 
 it’s hard to fight when the fight ends so like a dance, and shine 
 
 by the way 
 by the time i woke i was singing 
 
 [t-pain:] 
 i'm on a boat, whoa oh 
 
 when the feeling things can see you that i knew. 
 
 ooh, love's like this 
 it's something i missed 
 
 ooh, ooh, come a time that just all this wasted 
 
 but i never seen new much time 
 and i could wait patiently but i really wish you would... 
 
 drop it down 
 
 i wish you'd could only see that day 
 
 it was all a little 
 wonderful and strange 
 could you tell me then you 
 
 this is really happening 
 
 a thousand smiles
