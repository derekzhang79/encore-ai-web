 to stand back where they gave up 
 and pray for a sound we of innocence and it smells like a perfect little who honey 
 but i took your matches 
 before fire 
 the only reason is gone 
 wishing i should be able to handle this 
 i'm alive out your little new soundtrack 
 i never miss a bad break 
 what's the use of wondering why? 
 maybe i'm a fast train 
 blowing through a mountain 
 watching all my life just felt true 
 i ain't jealous of you 
 just let nobody see me 
 feet hanging out a pickup truck 
 crazy and a little rough 
 running free 
 that’s the closest to a fight 
 i remember your bare feet down the hallway 
 i remember 
 all i do 
 i'll keep writing songs about you and me 
 happy endings 
 don't break in your chips 
 
 i'm just living life as it goes 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 dreaming of you baby 
 i’ve been being patient 
 about a little thing i still don’t know he don’t need
