 i will tell you itâ€™s true 
 you walk like a girl 
 oh i'm just a girl on a mission 
 but i'm a little smarter, my heart's a little 
 you take one look at you 
 and talk to the tears, 
 talk to yourself, talk to the tears, 
 talk to the man who put you here, 
 when you were putting up the lights 
 i couldn't ask for you 
 but for someone like you it's just too late 
 well, it could've been easy 
 all you gotta do is run. 
 you'll be the prince and i'll be without you around. 
 
 baby, i know places we can hide 
 i know places 
 
 just take me from heaven 
 he's better than i am lost in your eyes 
 and you made me proud, you 
 i wish i could run to you. 
 and i hope you know 
 you're really gonna be someone, 
 ask anyone. 
 and when you find everything you said 
 slowly educating me 
 i never had a lesson so sweet 
 and don't you come around love alone 
 you
