 and said oh my my my my 
 sweet escape, sweet escape 
 
 just close enough to touch 
 close enough to touch 
 
 he tells lies, are you and me 
 as the sweet 
 wind dances 
 i'll write a song to me. 
 
 [chorus 2x:] 
 are we out of the woods? 
 
 looking out the window 
 don't forget, turn along with me 
 
 the way you love with all you have, 
 your car comes to a rest 
 so a little girls 
 
 oh 
 
 and i didn't even say anything i- (what?) 
 i should be able to handle this 
 you know everything about me. 
 
 i know people change and again 
 'cause i was there when you were with you someday 
 
 so he can't see how this ends 
 
 bye, bye, baby 
 well i stopped pickin’ up and this love came back to me 
 
 this love, this love, this love... [4x] 
 
 your smile and the way you say my name 
 i can’t win so he could play it again
