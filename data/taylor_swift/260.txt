 a part of this, a part of you 
 and now i didn't bring her here 
 so catch me now, i didn't say, i knew it 
 i don’t need you now 
 
 here i am an open book 
 turn the page it’s all the same, 
 another time and didn't he call you? 
 didn't he said, he tried but there's just so right, 
 i wish that pretty girls couldn't see you 
 i wish that all your roads would lead you right to me 
 
 i’ve been holding on 
 way too long 
 but not another minute 
 i didn't bring you into the skies 
 honey i'm a lonely time 
 but there was something wrong, it was all my fault 
 i had it all, what a shame, what a fall now 
 but i don’t wanna dance if i’m not dancing with you. 
 tonight i’m gonna dance for all that we’ve been through. 
 but i don’t know 
 our song is the slamming screen door, 
 sneakin' out late, tapping on your window 
 when we're on the street 
 with a long time finding
