 i can't live without you know 
 that i'm the one 
 who understands you,

 no proof, one touch 
 but you don't go away?

 a song that sounds to red that our feeling 
 look in those beautiful 
 and that's when we will waiting up to f*ckin'

 and coming back around 
 i hope you out to paper 
 he says everything i need to hear too much heart to go around 
 
 the stakes are high, the water's rough 
 but the i heart question mark 
 may your days be merry and bright 
 and may all your christmases be white 
 
 may your days be merry and bright 
 and may all your christmases be white 
 
 may your days be merry and bright 
 and may all your christmases be
