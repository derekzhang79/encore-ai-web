 and you and i 
 talk to your friends you ain't seen in a while 
 you've been good, busier than let you 
 
 back then fall 
 
 back up, 
 oh i just wanna show you 
 she don’t even know if i could escape 
 and i could tell you but i can't help but i wish i could feel that much 
 and that small town man and i could " 
 and i hope you know that this ain't no accidents to my because 
 
 it wasn't just like a way 
 
 in the middle of the parking lot 
 yeah it's two a.m. 
 feelin' like i just lost a friend. 
 hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me. 
 
 once i thought that love was something i don't miss those rude interruptions 
 
 and they come unstuck 
 
 lady, running down to the riptide 
 taken away to the dark room 
 meant just another picture 
 i’m fine just a bit of a mess 
 and i’m not perfect you could say 
 i wasn’t brought up that way 
 
 but
