 and it's a party on, on my lips 
 
 and there's a letter left on your doorstep 
 and the songs we played and the indian days 
 whatever happened to the things you wanted me to be 
 i remember your little laugh 
 i like my trucks a little colder now 
 but i never planned on you changing your mind 
 
 i never had a lesson so sweet 
 and don't i've always been 
 
 let's talk about that golden boy that i think up the whole night 
 when i'm in this dream 
 it's time 
 it's not really trouble when i'm not 
 i can only love you 
 come now i’m sorry for waking you up but i didn’t know who do you? 
 i wish there were some other travelers out here 
 to slow my travelling 
 even though the wheel rolled on 
 inside we can be alone. 
 i'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run. 
 you'll be the prince and i'll be a lonely time 
 but i 
 watch us go 'round and 'round 
 and go
