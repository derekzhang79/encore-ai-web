 i could tell you now but never mind 
 yeah, oh yeah 
 gonna see you cry, 
 pretends he doesn't know that iâ€™ve had him memorized for so long? 
 he sees everything black 
 and as 
 i won't tell my friend 
 we'll never been the same girl 
 
 talk to you forever 
 with the sun shining bright 
 it feels like one of those nights, 
 we ditch the whole scene 
 it feels like one of those nights, 
 we ditch the whole scene 
 it feels like easy 
 
 it would be a fine proposition, 
 it was rare, i was there, i remember it all too well 
 
 i don't wanna need you this way, 
 come back... be here. 
 i always forget to tell you i love you, i loved you 
 breakin' down and coming undone 
 it's a roller coaster kinda rush 
 and i never knew i could feel 
 he caught me staring at him 
 mad about him 
 little that i knew 
 it's something i missed 
 
 ooh, ooh, by the way 
 
 wasn't it beautiful runnin'
