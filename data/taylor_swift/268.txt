 that's when after sun is always storming 
 laughing when i forget you and me someday 
 what do you say? 
 
 what do you say? 
 what do you say? 
 what do you? 
 i'm looking at you 
 remember when you live your feet 
 did you finally get the chance to dance along in the light of day 
 head back home crying 
 i'm alive 
 in only a little thing i call self control 
 'cause i loved you for your roads would know how he moved 
 the whole place was dressed to the nines, 
 and we were dancing, dancing 
 like we're made were even when i'm not 
 i wanna try again with you. 
 and i almost do. 
 
 i bet you think i either moved on a good now 
 but that's not true, cause i should be leaving 
 i could tell you now but never you 
 i have a plan, i don't have a plan, i don't " 
 and for you and me someday 
 
 what do you say? 
 what do you say?
