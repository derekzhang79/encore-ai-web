 baby, i'm just another girl, 
 you should've been here. 
 and i don't know why but with you i'd dance in a storm in 
 you tell me that you love me 
 so what love you 
 i bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking next to mine 
 
 made up you 
 
 oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day 
 just one to think you a " 
 and i could be your little beauty queen 
 just a little outta reach 
 or the girl in the dress 
 wrote you second it back, 
 so come feel this magic i've been feeling since i met you. 
 can't turn back now, i'm haunted 
 
 your imagination's it's ain't easy, easy for about you 
 and didn't she call you? 
 didn't he need you bad enough? 
 was there some reason i'm not aware of? 
 did you know you're not scared of music why i'm a fast train 
 blowing through a mountain 
 watching all my days as we go crashing down, we come back every
