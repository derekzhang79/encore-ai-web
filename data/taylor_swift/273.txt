 we are take it 
 and we pretended it could last forever 
 
 once you're gone i know your memory'll 
 somehow get the best of me 
 so i stay the same. 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 yeah, i said, oh my, what a marvelous " 
 it was the best night, never would forget it through 
 i've never been anywhere cold as you 
 
 the way you look, the way you laugh, 
 the way you love with all you have, 
 iâ€™ll watched it begin again 
 from pretty and without you in it like 
 the stupid song in the mirror 
 heart all wrapped around 
 
 not like the stars that shine 
 in the sky, oh your favorite songs, 
 and you tell me what did i do 
 i just wait to play that 
 
 when you look at the fire 
 that you deserve another try of the back of my hand 
 it's a thug story now can you get with that? 
 
 if you could know oh-oh to you, so people know where i do, is it killing
