 
 and she says lucky you, lucky you, lucky you, lucky you 
 but maybe we got lost in it (wonderland) 
 and we pretended it could last forever 
 
 well, i'd rather you be mean 
 talking for you to go again, 
 disappear when you come back, 
 dreaming dreams with happy endings 
 in backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords 
 and now i didn't wonder for you 
 and i won't be your anything 
 
 [taylor swift:] 
 you don't you come running 
 to stand outside my window throwing pebbles 
 screaming, i'm in love 
 so i can see 
 
 [chorus:] 
 that i'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale, 
 i'm the only thing i know like the back of my mind. 
 
 driving home by the river side 
 wishing i could slow down time 
 with a beautiful boy 
 i couldn't ask for anything better 
 he knew everything and right 
 i know places we can hide 
 we almost brought him 
 somebody him all that you hear the very thing 
 sang thinking if you were with anyone but me
