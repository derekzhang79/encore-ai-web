 you know it used to be mad love 
 just close your eyes 
 the sun is going down 
 there's one guy, she's shy 
 sees him 
 
 snap buttons on the street 
 when you've burned the game 
 
 talk to the tears, 
 talk to the man with the reasons why, 
 and you tell me about your dreams. 
 make you feel so b-a-d 
 break you, make you sorry 
 i hope you cry getting my r-e-v-e-n-g-e 
 
 so i'm not picking up 
 
 'cause we were happy 
 
 yeah, we forget about the heartbreaks 
 it's time 
 
 made up you 
 
 can you see it now? 
 these walls that they put up to hold us back remember all of it 
 
 sixteen blue jeans, abercrombie t-shirt 
 shoes, purse, hair tied my room 
 we were lying on your couch 
 i remember 
 you took a polaroid of us 
 then discovered then discovered 
 the rest of the world 
 and i hope you could feel you like a perfect storm 
 
 rain came pouring
