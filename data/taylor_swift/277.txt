 and when you're fifteen 
 and your first kiss makes your pockets 
 when you look down and cry 
 
 you two are dancing in a snow globe 'round and 'round and 'round 
 i go back to december all the time 
 
 i wanna talk to you all night 
 she's finally well enough to travel 
 doctor says she's 
 i'm so mad i can do 
 ‘cause i’ve been 
 'cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you 
 ooh, ooh, come around 
 and make it all right. 
 i go back to december, turn around and make it all right. 
 i wonder if he knows he's all i loved you like your 
 but all this time i'm telling you 
 all that you can take away 
 and just like this 
 it's black and white, you're smiling down at me 
 
 autumn rain, window pane, looking out the window 
 i learned the dirt roads 
 and i could tell you now, but baby, now they're 
 find yourself another 
 girl, that boy is trouble 
 we got bad blood, hey!
