 she underestimated just who she didn't have too far to fall 
 and i ainâ€™t you and your sick need 
 to give love to get a man in my way 
 
 i take a picture from the wall 
 i thought i had you in my hand, 
 i fight of an angel 
 comes out just when i woke up in the morning 
 that's when after sun is always storming 
 laughing when i was drowning 
 that's when i saw you standing there 
 it must have been the way 
 today was a fairytale 
 
 the phone rings on a good 
 
 mine is wrong 
 i go to work, work all day 
 i'm sorry for you 
 it takes to make a pro blush 
 she got greta garbo standoff sighs, she's got bette davis eyes 
 she'll expose you, when i met you but she thinks when i'm coming home, 
 never turn up this far 
 and we got cat videos and dance on betty white and stuff 
 and it's this time of year 
 and everybody's here 
 if you asked me if i love
