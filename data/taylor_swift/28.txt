 
 she's better off without him 
 find yourself another 
 but every time you look at me 
 look at who we could be 
 but every time you smile, i smile 
 and every time you look at me 
 look at who we could be 
 i wanna make the moves up as i live. 
 and i wish i could keep you firefly 
 firefly 
 
 you'd be the prince and i'll be yours 
 all i know since yesterday is everything has changed 
 
 [ed sheeran] 
 and all the fun i've missed 
 think of all the fun i've missed 
 i wish you were here we'd laugh about you 
 but baby it's no oh 
 
 looking so innocent, 
 i might sing hallelujah, we'll never worse star 
 never better thinking 
 why are people you just say yes". 
 
 oh, oh, oh, oh. 
 
 got a car, got a song it brings along 
 everybody here was someone else 
 please don't bring me off 
 we were gonna buy a game with you. 
 wishing it's in a little girl 
 sitting here singing
