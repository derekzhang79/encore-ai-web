 you got that in my mind. 
 
 [taylor swift] 
 i just wanna know you, know you, know you 
 
 you and i 
 the first time 
 you made a really deep cut 
 and baby, know why i would die 
 before i let them see me 
 see the see when you think tim mcgraw 
 i hope you cry yours 
 i don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down, 
 and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now. 
 
 in dreams i tried to swerve. 
 people are people, and sometimes 
 i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i wish, i wish you knew, 
 just another picture to burn 
 baby, burn... me out when i'm wounded 
 you, picking on the weaker man 
 
 do you mean what you wear or who you know 
 i don't know why 
 i want to be where... 
 
 [chorus:] 
 you're not sorry no no oh 
 
 looking so innocent, 
 and i forget about you
