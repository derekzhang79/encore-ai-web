 for more to take a place that's there where you are 
 and everything i do, i 
 i almost do. 
 it's been hard and down 
 they say iâ€™ve always known 
 what i have to. 
 
 never say never 
 i need you tonight 
 
 just close your eyes 
 the sun is going down 
 we could be just as good 
 if you check off 
 
 hey, by the way... 
 
 [chorus:] 
 there's your trouble 
 
 and there's a whole a lot of good people in heaven 
 and i 
 
 one minute i held the keys 
 next the doors were closed on me 
 so hey, let's be friends 
 you're just another picture of it 
 i'm just living life and thinking 
 hey this could be fun 
 
 before you go, tell me this: 
 was it worth it? 
 was she worth this? 
 
 no... no, no, no... 
 
 [chorus] 
 a stranger in an all pass. 
 and said, okay, oh 
 never looked at you like the stars 
 and sometimes i wait for that "
