 buttons down to my face 
 but you run away 
 
 baby, i'm a walking tape recorder of its hand 
 
 will my love come in a bowl of blue 
 and in the end in wonderland we both went mad. 
 it out of the corner 
 you're my one and only friend 
 i wish that i could touch 
 you go to work, work all day 
 i'm a walking tape recorder of everything you say 
 walk to my car, dig out my keys 
 with my mind i play it through 
 
 it would take brad pitt to leave you 
 it takes five seconds to need one 
 
 missing you like this is how it ought to be. 
 pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks. 
 we thought would last forever and ever (forever) 
 
 they say i’ve always known 
 what i wanted 
 my friends and enemies 
 will tell you it’s true 
 and you’ll will find out 
 i always get it 
 i know what i want 
 to sing to you 
 
 waiting for the words you made us proud,
