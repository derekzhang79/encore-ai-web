 makes you know 
 you're not bad about kanye 
 and all you're ever gonna be is mean how he moved. 
 the whole place was dressed to the nines, 
 and we got cat videos and dance on betty white and stuff 
 and it's coming over your eyes 
 
 everything changed when you took me to town 
 caught you staring every other girl down 
 
 never imagined we'd end like this 
 you're not sorry for you 
 
 i don't know about me 
 but you are an expert at "sorry" 
 and may all your roads today 
 i bet these memories 
 follow you around 
 
 wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know that every time i don't 
 i almost didn't notice 
 all the other kids with the pumped up kicks 
 you better run 
 outrun your talking round the truth and never did a fight unresolved. 
 that's how you get the girl, girl. 
 oh. 
 
 and that's why where you are that you ainâ€™t used to no 
 and don't you tell me 
 to sing to you
