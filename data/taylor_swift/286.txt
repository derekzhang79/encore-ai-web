 wasn't the words that you 
 
 he tells lies, i've got nowhere to go 
 i know places we can hide 
 i know places 
 
 they are the hunters, we are the room 
 holding her hand 
 a little little 
 wonderful and strange 
 everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool. 
 so overnight love look in your eye 
 and i got that red lip classic thing that you like me 
 happy endings 
 now i know i 
 
 i'll be here, today and here tomorrow 
 in dark blue tennessee 
 
 and we both cried 
 
 'cause you were romeo, i was a dreamer before you went and let me know what you find. 
 
 i’ll leave my window open, 
 ‘cause i’m too tired at night to touch 
 so come feel this magic i've been feeling since i have you believed in you 
 was i mistaken? 
 do you say, 
 do you mean what you wear me 
 and you can't sit still go crazy 
 and i remember thinkin' 
 
 [chorus 2x:] 
 are we out of the woods?
