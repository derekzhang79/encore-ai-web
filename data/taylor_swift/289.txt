 la la la 
 
 just close your eyes 
 the sun is going down 
 we could be just as good 
 if you need love i'll be making you 
 i wish that i don't know you at all. 
 
 christmas joke about the night 
 getting swept away from the same time 
 it's miserable and magical. 
 oh, yeah 
 just like the ones i used to know 
 so may your days be merry and bright 
 and said, i'm sorry, i didn't make " 
 and you made me crazy died 
 
 and i don’t want you back 
 i want you back 
 i had to, 
 
 wake up and find 
 she wasn't brought up that way 
 
 for a perfect chick 
 cause that one is something decent to save me from tears 
 i'll give it to memphis 
 and this little old town just hasn’t new ambition 
 i need you now 
 that was a star, 
 i guess what you wrote on a paper 
 wasn't really in your heart 
 could've sworn you said you needed space. (what?)
