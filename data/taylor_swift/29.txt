 just a shot, just a shot in the dark, oh oh 
 all i'll never know 
 it just all comes back. but he never does. 
 i think of who you could be 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 burn, burn, burn, baby, burn 
 you're better off, you're better off 
 they can talk forever, they just don't know you at all. 
 stumbled through the long goodbye, 
 one last kiss, then catch your flight, 
 right when we couldn't take the heat 
 i always get it 
 i know what i want 
 and it ain’t you 
 and it rains in your bedroom 
 everything is taking to 
 i thought you know 
 all the ways you made me 
 
 there ain't no accidents in what we do 
 
 walked before that lost the time 
 
 you might have but if you look at me right now 
 can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh. 
 
 hold on, make it easy 
 cause i guess i wished on a plane 
 and i hope you know that every time i drive away, 
 cause
