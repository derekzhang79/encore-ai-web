 i could give you fifty reasons 
 why i should be leaving 
 i should be love 
 but you're quicksand 
 
 this slope is treacherous 
 [taylor swift] i think that it's best of me 
 so i question over new york 
 welcome to new york 
 welcome to new york 
 
 it's a new soundtrack 
 i could dance to this beat 
 
 wish you could be trusted 
 did you go away? 
 was there if you just wanna stay right here at " 
 
 oh, we made quite the drive 
 you never did, you never light again 
 she thinks about it 
 
 could it run for cover but you're untouchable 
 burning brighter than the sun 
 did you notice one less pair of hands 
 
 i know you just never ainâ€™t you, 
 i remember who you wanna be with me too 
 so i'mma stay through it 
 
 but darling, we found wonderland 
 you and i got lost in it 
 and we were happy 
 
 i do you made up our last night? 
 
 tell me boy now
