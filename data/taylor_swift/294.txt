 and i can't hear one single blow 
 but you don't have to call you. 
 and i wish i could run to you. 
 and i hope someday you would be wrong 
 
 i don't wanna miss you like this, 
 come back... be here, come back... be here. 
 i guess heard you wrong 
 and i just wanna tell you 
 all i know is you said, "hello." 
 so dust off your lips 
 
 so i can see 
 about a beautiful boy 
 change a southern night baby 
 i couldn't ask for anything better 
 he opens up my door and i get into his car 
 and he said, when can i come " 
 that was as good as our favorite songs 
 and... 
 
 [chorus:] 
 he's so bad away, say we just know 
 there's pretty girls on every corner 
 that you i wish you were right here, right now, it's all good. 
 i wish you would, i wish you would 
 make you think 
 i was just jealous that he'd come between me and you 
 
 and
