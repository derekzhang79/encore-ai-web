 to run 
 
 and someone can i go with you? 
 oh, daddy can i go with you? 
 oh, daddy can i go with you? 
 oh, daddy can i go with you? 
 oh, daddy can i go with you? 
 oh, daddy can i go with you? 
 oh, daddy come a little closer 
 oh, oh, i love you i love you 
 all the nice days 
 when fear crept into my mind 
 you gave me a ring 
 
 and it would take brad pitt in your hands but i could be your little beauty queen 
 this is a big world, that was a small town 
 and i knew i wasn't gonna take this very well 
 but i'd rather you be mean 
 than have to say you love em, and time don't be afraid to 
 jump then fall 
 
 and i said, i'll just wait for the day 
 take it easy baby 
 make it last all my friends 
 without you coming up 
 itâ€™s like i'm always known 
 what i wanted you to chase after me 
 
 are you
