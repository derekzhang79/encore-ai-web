 i know we've got a lot to say between now and forever 
 but at a little stars 
 spelling out your name 
 you out clubbing but i just couldn't see. 
 
 [chorus:] 
 well i hope you think that little black dress 
 think of my head on a silver plate 
 just a small town boy and girl 
 livin' in a crazy world. 
 tryin' to figure out what we thought would never leave her 
 she's got her hopes up 
 got 'em up to there 
 wondering what to say 
 now we got problems 
 and i know the mistake i'd be making 
 
 cuz if you live it 
 you showed me what living is 
 a love so strong 
 that you cry, but you could play our way 
 
 [chorus 2x:] 
 are we out of the woods? 
 
 looking at it 
 
 red and we both cried 
 
 'cause one second it was perfect 
 you can't see i love you, 
 you can't get here fast 
 it's been waiting for you 
 welcome to new york 
 
 it's
