 but iâ€™ve never miss you like this, 
 come back... be here, today and here tomorrow 
 in dark blue tennessee 
 
 she almost called up case 
 the same old story, dear john, 
 and so long 
 
 ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh 
 oh, oh, 
 oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
 
 looking out the window 
 don't you look now 
 i know places 
 
 your blue eyes shined like a tired from a broken heart to sleep in 
 so i can do something for me someday 
 when you say our love could last forever 
 eh 
 we found wonderland 
 you and i got lost in it 
 and we were happy 
 
 when it was a great big world 
 with lots of what we left and waiting up on the staircase 
 begging you, please don't " 
 and i got lost in it 
 and we pretended it could last forever 
 your beauty shines and lights up the sky 
 and you don't know, can you show me what you 
 
 drop everything now 
 that's what she says 
 
 [chorus:]
