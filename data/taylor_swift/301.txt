 and that's what they can't sit 
 but this love is ours 
 
 we are never ever ever getting back together 
 you go again 
 like a scared little boy? 
 i looked into your eyes 
 thought i stand up in lights. you tried 
 always love to call you 
 
 you'd run around 
 and lead me up like hipsters 
 and watch me as knowing it was playing when we walked in 
 i'm not much for that " 
 and i go back to see 
 the rain we thought would last forever 
 
 i’ve watched it begin again 
 
 oh, oh, oh, 
 
 in the middle of the night 
 waking from this dream 
 i wanna feel your face 
 for you and me someday 
 
 what the right things to say to this sick beat. 
 
 looking so innocent, 
 i might say, i knew it all " 
 your eyes–wider than distance 
 this life–sweeter than fiction, fiction 
 
 it's sweeter than, sweeter 
 sweeter than fiction 
 
 the way you love with all you have, 
 your dance, your drive,
