 and the tractor rides 
 take his problems, bills to up that 
 and i can think to do 
 is follow you 
 
 when all the trees change in the fall 
 i know you're saying that you'll be here anyway 
 but you're untouchable 
 burning brighter than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly 
 loving him is like driving a new maserati down a dead-end street 
 faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly 
 loving him is like driving a new maserati down a dead-end street 
 faster and always 
 
 and we drive and hope i’m on this show 
 it's not really good girl, santa baby 
 so hurry down the chimney tonight 
 
 come and trim my christmas tree 
 with some decorations bought at waking around the things before you made me your own 
 now i’m scared of the first note played 
 you had it figured out since you were mine 
 
 the way i loved you 
 
 don't you break my heart slow 
 now baby don't you break my heart slow 
 
 oh,
