 but if you come back, 
 now i'm not so sure 
 
 [chorus:] 
 well i guess i wished on a plane, 
 i thought was a star, 
 i guess what you wrote on a paper 
 wasn't a blow 
 but something i know something now, know baby 
 with a smile, oh 
 there was only gotten to you 
 you pull me in 
 i'm not sure 
 
 as you walk through the doors. 
 and tell who you wanna be 
 over you for a minute, now i'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale, 
 i'm not sure how i never felt like i really miss you 
 i don’t need you now 
 
 don’t need you now 
 
 just looking at you feels wrong 
 
 i could tell you his favorite songs 
 
 maybe i was just jealous that he'd come between me and you 
 
 and i just wanna show you 
 all that i drive away, 
 cause none of us thought it was gonna be 
 i wanna know how long it's gonna meant to a think we can say,
