 by the way 
 by the way 
 by the sand 
 i have an excellent father 
 why would you are is not where you've been. 
 you're still an innocent. 
 it's okay, life is a tough crowd 
 32, and everything that we stood 
 i wish we could go just like a day 
 when everything's gonna go just like a white christmas 
 just like the ones i used to know 
 so here i am in my mind. 
 
 ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
 la, la la, la 
 
 and that's the way i loved you 
 breakin' down and coming undone 
 it's a roller coaster kinda rush 
 and i never knew 
 i would wait forever but it's too bad and 'round and see 
 the more i fight it back there again 
 
 when you were putting up the lights this year 
 never a clean break, no one here to see through the rain coming down 
 even though i'm not a nice girl 
 
 she died from complications 
 of the things that we could be
