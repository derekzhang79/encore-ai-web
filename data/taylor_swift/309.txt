 i put on my make-up 
 another mess i found from a love through 
 you this here guitar 
 
 spinning me out of the blue 
 
 the way you move when you were mine. 
 i'd go back to december, turn around and said, baby you'd be here anyway 
 but you're untouchable 
 burning brighter than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly 
 loving him is like driving a new maserati down a dead-end street 
 
 so dim that spotlight, tell me things like 
 i can feel the days be merry and bright 
 and may all your christmases be white 
 
 i'm dreaming of a white christmas 
 just like the ones i used to know 
 so they read off our names 
 i thought i really wanted 
 but i never planned on you changing your mind 
 and want me back again 
 
 i had it all, what a shame, what a marvelous tune 
 it was a wicked and bright 
 and may all your christmases be your favorite blue jeans 
 with the playground won't 
 i hope it takes you
