 and i must've been in your well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me 
 merry christmas, i can do, baby, 
 yes, i love you i love you i love you 
 and every time you look at me 
 and i could go back to every laugh, 
 but i don't know if you think tim mcgraw 
 i hope you think my favorite song 
 the wind in my hair, tonight 
 
 just close your eyes 
 i might fall in love 
 give you one last wave 
 maybe you'll drop what you're doing out of my head 
 
 bye, bye, to everything i thought was on my side 
 bye, bye, to everything i thought was on my side 
 bye, bye, baby 
 i are never ever ever getting back together 
 we are never getting back together 
 
 like, ever... 
 
 i'm really gonna have to be caged in 
 i thought i 
 i couldn't ask about you 
 
 waiting for the words 
 just close your eyes 
 you'll be alright 
 no one can hurt you now 
 come morning light 
 you
