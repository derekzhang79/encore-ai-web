 he's the song in the car i see you found somebody new 
 so i’ve been holding on 
 way too long 
 but the very first page 
 not where the story line ends 
 
 so this is when the feeling sinks in, 
 i don't know how i feel right 
 take it all back to my front door. 
 oh, oh. 
 
 'cause that you see what you're doing to me 
 tell me 
 and how can i ever been " 
 and the people that we meet 
 why would you find my peace 
 
 and i saw them in the bad blood 
 you know it used to be mad love 
 so take a look what you've done 
 heard what i'm trying to say, oh 
 i meet you 
 all i know, can you find something to " 
 
 he’d never tell you they love something 
 and there's nothing more to say 
 it's looking for a reason, i know 
 when we got lost in it (wonderland) 
 and life was never
