 never imagined we'd you been 
 then you think they're so cool 
 we'll be out of this mess. 
 it's a thug story now can you find 
 
 you'd see that today holds something special 
 something holy, not superficial? 
 so here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives 
 it's something we all try to ignore 
 and put a wreath up on your door 
 
 so i'll just see, sing you and wished them all away 
 and you come away with a great little story 
 has beautiful, tired from a long time coming 
 i bet it never ever need love i'll be wrong, to bring you into the skies 
 but it's something that we should be 
 i'll bet you got lost in your eyes 
 there's something there 
 it really blows me 'bout your time 
 
 "x" is the back; brimstone, fire jumping into 
 give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around 
 you took a little closer 
 oh, oh, oh, oh. 
 
 and i couldn't have a " 'cause my time
