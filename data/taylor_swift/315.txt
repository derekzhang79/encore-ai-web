 look at you to get your attention 
 be one ain't 
 thinking all love ever does is break and come back someone new 
 and that's what i learned from you, oh you, oh yeah, ooh oh yeah 
 oh oh 
 
 all you are tonight 
 oh iâ€™m getting your trouble 
 
 so you know i wanna try again with you. 
 and i said, whoever said 
 a beat of your heart 
 
 for a while i thought that i didn't even knew you and 
 just looking like a contest, 
 on our feet 
 thinking all love ever does is break and burn and go 
 
 and it would take brad pitt to leave you 
 suddenly life, seems just like a single night 
 through all the fun i've missed 
 makes you see the starlight, starlight? 
 don't you dream impossible things? 
 i'm gonna miss you picking fights 
 and i got that red lip classic thing that you like 
 and when we've had our very first fight 
 the one we danced to all night for you
