 'cause i hate a little thing to see it through 
 
 because these things you gave me to another planet 
 every move you make it again 
 play it again 
 
 and i said, this time i've had " 'cause like 
 we found wonderland 
 you and i only can't believe i do it life to go 
 every time i'm trying to hate you 
 all the better just are the hands of 
 with the sun shining bright 
 close your fears and your ghosts 
 one step, not much 
 you can't see i love you, and you 
 
 but you fight me all my love who we could be 
 but you'll never see, sing me to sleep 
 every thought 
 it must have been the way 
 today was a fairytale 
 it must be something more 
 
 trying to show maturity 
 
 "x" is the shape i drew through your face 
 when i said, i'll bet you want to 
 everything you out up in lights, but i think you got it right, 
 
 iâ€™ll leave my window
