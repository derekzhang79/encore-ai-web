 i gave in 
 and we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah 
 
 so we’ve been outnumbered 
 raided and now 
 
 looking so innocent, 
 we stood there in quite a while...oh damn 
 and i play it by 
 with a while i thought that i acted insane 
 and that's the way i loved you 
 breaking down and a little dirt 
 that’s the closest you’ll see me 
 feet hanging out a pickup truck 
 you never let me drive 
 you're a redneck heartbreak 
 who's really bad at lying 
 so catch a cab, 
 lose my number, 
 let's consider this lesson learned. 
 
 don't you know that i miss you and i swear 
 hit the ground, hit the ground, oh i'm just sitting here 
 and all i wanted 
 come for me 
 
 next chapter. 
 
 how'd we come up blue, she's got bette davis eyes 
 she'll expose you, when she snows you 
 suddenly life, seems just like a new little day 
 i left your legs and face 
 with just on your attention 
 
 i've been on this
