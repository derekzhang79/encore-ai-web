 
 did you go away? 
 tell me what would you find 
 
 this love is glowing in the dark 
 talking 'bout your daddy's farm 
 we were sick and tired of your reasons 
 call a cab, 
 lose me a wishing star 
 as coming 
 and tried to open your eyes 
 and will you take a moment, promise me this 
 that this is really happening 
 oh,that this is really happening 
 that this is really happening 
 
 tell me,oh 
 it's not really anything anything 
 never turn the mandolin 
 mandolin 
 he's not the first to cry 
 i'm not the first to cry 
 i'm not the first to cry 
 i'm not the first to see you this 
 
 small town daydream 
 lasted all night 
 cussing out all those bright city lights 
 just look at you 
 i wish i could stand up and sing you a song, 
 but i took your matches 
 before i had somewhere to be 
 
 so said i could go back to me, 
 i remember, oh, it's so entertaining when you're not in
