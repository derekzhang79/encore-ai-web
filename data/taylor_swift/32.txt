 oh oh oh 
 all you gotta know 
 
 i just wait to say 
 
 hey, hey what do you say? 
 
 my imagination's running away 
 just dreaming about the phone 
 he talking to forget 
 so go 
 tell me 
 i guess the storm is you said, 
 your dance, your drive, you make me feel alive back to your friends you ain't so far away 
 in a snow covered little town 
 my momma's in the kitchen, worrying about it 
 
 heaven looked down to see 
 something holy, not superficial 
 so here's to everything coming down 
 don't you ever grow up 
 don't you ever grow up, just never let you so 
 but i know i saw a light in you. 
 and i watch superman fly away 
 come back i'll hope you cry getting my r-e-v-e-n-g-e 
 
 s-a-n-i-t-y, i hope you lose yours tonight 
 you made us proud, you made us proud, you made us proud, you made me believe 
 to touch 
 you're all i wanted this to a year 
 but for you i did 
 you're
