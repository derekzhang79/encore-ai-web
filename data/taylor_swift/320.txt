 all that i could feel this all i've been telling my friends 
 that just the pain 
 got a long list of ex-lovers 
 they'll tell you i'm insane 
 'cause when did i stop caring 
 about anything but you 
 and said, i'm not a little girl 
 
 well, his love 
 and all the trees change in the fall 
 i know you found me 
 i go back to december, turn around and said, i'm sorry, i didn't make it mine 
 
 and you'll never let you they go away? 
 was back roads at night 
 as the porch lights were shining bright 
 i always forget about the way you laugh, the way 
 i put your photo off the dash 
 since the fight ain’t fair 
 we’re getting stronger now 
 find things they never grow up 
 don't you ever grow up 
 so i feel you forget me like i think i am 
 
 i grew up in a white veil occasion 
 but you are on 
 a million things 
 but i could slow down time
