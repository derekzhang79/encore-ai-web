 unbelievable 
 instead of just invisible. 
 
 there’s a fire inside of you 
 i don’t need you now 
 i'm gonna burn it through 
 
 because in the blink of a pretty brown eye 
 i'll be right here on the back of my hand 
 without you, hey, by the way... 
 
 [chorus:] 
 i just wanna feel okay again 
 
 [sammy adams:] 
 double platinum wherever she go ready 
 heartbeat steady 
 keep your eyes open 
 
 everybody's waiting for you and long, baby 
 i like the way you tease 
 by now i can see my way your hair falls in your eyes 
 and that's what i intend to do 
 now i'm standing alone on a paper 
 remember when the cold hard ground 
 oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble 
 i have been the one to believe in 
 you have knocked me off my feet 
 they make it so tough 
 'cause everyone i was losing my mind when i caught your eye 
 and i could go on and on, on 
 it's like i just say this year 
 i'll bet
