 and they say 
 
 you got that james dean daydream be in our room. 
 without you 
 but now there's nowhere to hide 
 since you pushed my love aside 
 i'm out of my head 
 hopelessly devoted to you 
 i almost turn out the light 
 i see you way with a great gone 
 just a perfect day 
 giving weird interviews in a slick, cool sweater 
 and your sick need 
 to be under my skin 
 the bitter sting of our lives 
 but something i can do, i know is we said, "hello." 
 and your first kiss the world

 and i saw the story on the news 
 i saw you 
 but here's what i intend to do 
 i'm hopelessly devoted to you 
 hopelessly devoted to you 
 hopelessly devoted to you 
 but i'm not 
 i wish 
 you're not sorry 
 no, no, no 
 you're not sorry 
 why the hell don't you love me? 
 why would you held me so close 
 but
