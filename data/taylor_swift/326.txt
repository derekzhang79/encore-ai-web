 silent night, holy she always at a bad times 
 and i never (never) saw you coming 
 and i'll like you caught up 
 'cause time i am no on my show 
 it's been waiting for you 
 welcome to new york new york 
 it's been waiting for you 
 and i can feel you like your sick 
 oh my my my my 
 
 well, i have a way of coming easily to me 
 'cause i can't help myself. 
 
 myself, 
 can't help myself, 
 i can't wait for the day i stop pretending 
 that i'm doing real well, 
 and don't you are that i ain't 
 let's talk about your childhood days 
 they were there, i don't know you at all. 
 wind was a wicked and wild wind 
 blew down the misletoe
