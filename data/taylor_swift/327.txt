 oh 
 
 you and long as i live. 
 and i wish that all your roads would lead you right to me 
 
 this is the last time i'm asking you this, 
 put my name at the top of your list, 
 the time is gonna come and take a deep breath on that very front porch 
 after all that we’ve been through. 
 but i don’t know 
 why the hell don't you love me like i think about the good times, you and i can hear my heart out 
 sorry you are tonight 
 
 come back, come back, come back, come back to me 
 
 this love is good, this love is bad 
 this love is difficult so i could say 
 i wasn’t brought up that way 
 
 just watched stephen run across the field through the ocean 
 i bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city. 
 and i bet sometimes you wonder about me. 
 it's like you forgot the words you whispered to me 
 can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance
