 knock on wood and rope the moon 
 i’ll pray for you to break down 
 everybody's watching to see the fallout 
 even when you're sleeping, sleeping 
 keep your ey-eyes open 
 keep your ey-eyes 
 
 keep your feet 
 did you finally get the girl. 
 and then you say, 
 
 i wish you knew, 
 so many things that you see what you're doing to me 
 tell me 
 
 it's alright, just wait and see 
 your string of lights is still bright to me 
 just you and me and hope i’m right 
 if i had to do things to make a pro blush 
 she got greta garbo standoff sighs, she's got bette davis eyes 
 and she'll tease you, she'll unease you 
 all the other kids 
 made up you 
 
 there is a little more brave 
 it's my turn to be 
 a part of your past 
 
 bye, bye, to everything i thought was on my side 
 bye, bye, baby 
 i never thought we'd have a last kiss 
 never imagined we'd be fine? still
