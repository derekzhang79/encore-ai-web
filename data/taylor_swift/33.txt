 but all you are is mean 
 i'm tryin' so hard 
 
 all the other kids with the pumped up kicks 
 you better run 
 you better run 
 you better run 
 you better run 
 you better run 
 something's made your eyes go cold 
 be a little hand's wrapped around my finger 
 and it's moving so fast 
 though i wanna find 
 a perfect day 
 that someday you smile and i'll be yours 
 all i know since yesterday is everything has changed 
 
 yeah, all the things that she does 
 on the 
 smokey black nights 
 
 so as love ever happens 
 could it be so hard 
 to realign a star or two 
 change a southern night for you 
 but she got bette davis eyes 
 she'll expose you, when she snows you 
 she knows you, she's got bette davis eyes 
 she'll be a year today 
 been looking tonight 
 
 never grow up, 
 
 do you mean 
 when you're fifteen 
 and it's so quiet in the road
