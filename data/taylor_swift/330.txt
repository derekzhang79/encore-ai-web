 i should have be bigger 
 but every time you look at me i could touch 
 you go i hope you think that you've found you even 
 missed yourself 
 i'm only up when you're not for me and tell me how much better now 
 and i knows how to be your friends 
 which apparently is a crime 
 
 i never believed in you 
 
 you and me 
 baby this is what we do 
 i may see 
 there are people that i wished you 
 i was begging you, but i hate you but i don’t know 
 where i need is on the other side of town 
 with his head in his baby 
 oh, and i'll go back in time and change it on the night 
 with that save me from tears 
 i'll be sick inside if baby you'd be my cure 
 
 they say i’ve always known 
 what i wanted 
 my friends and enemies 
 will tell you it’s true 
 and you’ll will find out 
 i always get it 
 i know what a fool i've been
