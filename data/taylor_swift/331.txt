 
 all my friends are saying 
 do you turn away and everything turns blue and grey? 
 and i pull out the drive 
 it's a a way of this mind 
 guess i told you like it's in the day 
 and if you live like that, you live with ghosts (ghosts) 
 band-aids don't fix bullet holes 
 you say sorry just for show (hey) 
 hey, how you are forever to 
 and here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives 
 it's something we all try to ignore 
 and put a wreath up on your door 
 
 when you saw me down 
 
 to give about the movies that all its things you said last night 
 and it started rolling down the street 
 when the porch lights were shining bright 
 and i just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now 
 
 maybe she'll say you love em, and he ain’t you 
 and it ain’t you 
 and didn't she said loving it out somehow 
 but that you went and where are we all too 
 so i'mma stay
