 
 well you find me like a wine-stained dress i can't wear anymore 
 
 hung my head as i lost the war, and the sky turned black nights 
 
 all you had to do was be simple 
 oh, so you and i 
 watch the fire went out 
 sorry for the inconvenience, i didn't mean to let you go 
 
 down came the rain 
 lightning and thunder 
 we tried in vain 
 to the crickets sing. 
 you change in time 
 makes you feel so empty inside 
 
 but love's got me cornered in the back of the room 
 i'm spinning around, i'm spinning around 
 and all i see is you 
 
 oh yeah, all right 
 she was an american girl 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 [taylor swift album version / ed sheeran remix version):] 
 and all i think about is how to make you think of me 
 
 as the stars fall down and the heavens fade 
 this girl is begging wait for me 
 
 can you tell me now, youâ€™re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.
