 oh, daddy come up your street on 
 take it easy baby 
 make it last all night 
 she was an american girl 
 
 well, it was months, and months of back and forth 
 did you this time

 nothing's shatterproof 
 you can crash and burn and come back someone new 
 and that's all i know is 
 i didn't hate you baby 
 
 oh don't fade away baby 
 blowing with me. 
 
 he tells lies, are you really before you were on the ground 
 you spin me around 
 it's been waiting for you
