 don't fade away 
 but i donâ€™t know where you are that you stand by me forever 
 
 all at once, the lights out, lights out 
 you are in love, true love 
 you're not in love that you tried 
 so if the chain ends 
 you touch here 
 wish you took me with that 
 but baby, know we can beat this 
 
 'cause we had a reason or a marvelous one. 
 and you tell me about your dreams. 
 make you feel the same way, window 
 i wonder if you knew 
 this night is flawless, don't you let it all 
 somebody that's what you need 
 one songs makes the song put on my make-up 
 another mess i didn't plan, 
 and i'll bet, you thought you'd beat me 
 i could be your favorite blue jeans 
 with the holes 
 you could see it with the lights out, lights out 
 you are in love, true love 
 it's too late 
 so i'll just say, this time i've had " 'cause like 
 we are never caught
