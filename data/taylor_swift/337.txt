 we both wake in lonely beds in different cities 
 and this time how could you left in the corner 
 or were you someone's best friend 
 this here guitar 
 
 i wake up, i stretch out 
 i wonder what you're doing right here 
 and i know it's right here hopin’, 
 that you’ll come in with the rain. 
 
 i could give you fifty friends 
 that's when after sun is always storming 
 laughing when i was just living life and thinking 
 hey this could be fun 
 
 before you ask me if i'm alright, 
 think about what we’ve worked for all these years 
 the way you knew 
 i don't anymore 
 
 and i stare at the phone 
 i just wanna know you, know you, know 
 
 buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train 
 i'm gonna miss you bad enough? 
 was there some reason i'm not aware of? 
 did you not write a damn song 
 a girl on a mission 
 but i'm ready to fly 
 
 all because of ellen
