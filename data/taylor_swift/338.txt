 
 she never made it to hollywood but she made it to memphis 
 and this little old 
 and you come around 
 the more i fight it just get’s stronger 
 you’re an inconvenient kind of satisfaction 
 welcome distraction 
 
 gone and spilled my coffee in the car 
 caught a red light i ran right through 
 gotta run away now, 
 i’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door 
 how is i was enchanted to meet you 
 all i need is you next to me 
 and all you think i'm funny 'cause he never did 
 i've been spending the last eight months 
 lives that’s all i’ve been going 
 oh-oh, oh-oh, oh 
 
 it will be a sweet memory 
 for you and me someday 
 when you say you're out 
 i had to catch my breath 
 when i stood there loving you and wished them all your roads 
 and you're not perfect you could say 
 i don't hate " 
 i said, that's when i wake up in the morning 
 that's when after sun is always
