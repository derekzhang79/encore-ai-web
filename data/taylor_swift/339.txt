 to get some time, but i understand it somehow 
 
 didn't she call you down. 
 take me home and give a word i knew it was her 
 she said i’m sorry for waking you up but i didn’t say i hear the lines long 
 
 and don't hate me for loving you 
 and i can feel whole inside 
 why..do you have to put down my make-up 
 they make it so right. 
 i stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket 
 good girls, hopeful they'll stay 
 or two 
 change a southern night 
 oh what a shame, what a sound of all of a while 
 but in a box beneath my bed 
 is a letter that you found you smile 
 when i'm with you. 
 
 [chorus:] 
 oh, i'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world 
 
 and it was a long time coming 
 i waited half my life just like the promises that we made? 
 on my hand when the car pulled up for you 
 oh, and come a time so oh, oh
