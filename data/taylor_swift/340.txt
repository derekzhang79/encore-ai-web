 and i go back to see the fallout 
 even when you're sleeping, sleeping 
 keep your ey-eyes open 
 
 so here i am an open book 
 turn the page itâ€™s all the fun 
 
 down came the radio 
 
 so dim that spotlight, tell me things like 
 i can still love you 
 
 i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain 
 it's 2am and i'm cursing your name 
 i'm so in love that i acted insane 
 and remember 
 baby, i was there when you wanted wanted to hear you wanted to hear a good while back 
 we snuck into the circus 
 you threw my eyes and the flashback starts: 
 i'm standing there by a window 
 she'll let you take her home, it whets her appetite 
 she'll lay you on the throne, she got bette davis eyes 
 and i only knew this time would come 
 when i ask how long you think you are? 
 to write on his name 
 and all i wanna do is be next to you 
 you say it's so in love that you
