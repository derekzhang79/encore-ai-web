 but you never did, you never did 
 take me back together back together 
 your necklace hanging from my neck 
 the night when i ask how long you think you're gonna be 
 you say, this crazy world's come undone 
 
 summer's over and leaves begin to fall 
 but every time i look at you now, " 
 i'll be a fine proposition, 
 'cause it's late and your mama don't know 
 our song is the way you tease 
 by now i can do 
 ‘cause i’m better than 
 
 all throughout the day 
 you made a really deep cut 
 and, baby, now i'm not so sure 
 so this time 
 but i don’t wanna’ always live 
 counting every bird 
 i miss you like a ghost 
 but just, baby, we're over to all the fray 
 cause i, i like the way you wanted love 
 so take a look what you've got 
 
 boys don't be afraid to 
 jump then fall 
 
 the bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet 
 i'll catch you, i'll catch you 
 the time
