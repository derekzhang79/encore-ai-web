 keep your ey-eyes open 
 keep your ey-eyes open 
 keep your ey-eyes open 
 keep your ey-eyes open 
 keep your ey-eyes 
 
 keep your feet 
 all the sleepless nights or the endless fights 
 i might miss you bad but 
 can’t call it love if you ain’t in it 
 
 once you might as well sit back 
 'cause it seems like a perfect day 
 that i left when i called 
 
 i like the way you move when you took my place 
 and the battle was long, it’s the fight of our lives 
 but we’ll stand up champions tonight 
 
 i never talked about the tears i cried 
 all the sleepless nights or the endless fights 
 i might fall in love 
 give you the benefit of the doubt, every single time 
 and then you walk right by, i'm screaming out inside 
 why you gotta be so?... 
 and all you're ever gonna be is mean 
 why you gotta be so?... 
 someday all me 
 so take a look what you've done 
 don't look where i'll be
