 i always knew this time would come 
 but by the way 
 that i see sparks fly whenever you smile 
 didn't matter where i'd been 
 'cause i'd seen the sky 
 i think you fell out of the sky today 
 i bet you're tired from a long hard week. 
 i bet you're tired from a long hard week. 
 i bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking next into mine 
 like i did before 
 you're not sorry, no no, oh 
 
 you were never a saint 
 and my daddy said, stay away from " 
 
 oh, oh, oh, 
 oh, but something's different this time, 
 she donâ€™t even know you, 
 but it's so entertaining watching you breathing 
 a little pathway headed for the skies 
 left to travels, lives they unravel 
 when she got up again 
 she got up again 
 the best people in life are free 
 
 and life was never worse but never better
