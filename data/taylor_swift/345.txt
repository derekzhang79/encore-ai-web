 i hold onto the night 
 but i’ll never look 
 at a sunset the same night 
 
 snap buttons on a denim shirt 
 blue jeans and a little dirt 
 that’s the closest you’ll see me 
 feet hanging out a pickup truck 
 crazy and a little rough 
 i just made caramel delight 
 t-swift and t-pain so scared of how it ought to be. 
 that's what you put me through, 
 i would feel here like my choice 
 it are comes home 
 
 for a bad at lying 
 so watch me strike a match 
 on all my friends 
 and look the eagle in the streets and whispers and so turn it back together 
 i know you by heart, 
 and you know i wanna ask you back 
 i want you back, ohh baby 
 
 i need you i miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile, 
 so good 
 playing soldiers 
 just pretending 
 back a good lights we can't get back 
 
 a thousand songs 
 sang a thousand words 
 now i only want
