 i keep waiting for you, but it's real. 
 don't be afraid to 
 jump then fall 
 like the whole thing 
 guess you gotta run sometimes 
 maybe he forget about a single vow 
 
 need you 
 when i'm mad at all the lovebirds 
 'cause they know all the steps up to your door, 
 but i do 
 
 and our mamas smiled 
 and rolled their eyes and said oh 
 
 it would be wrong to 
 
 so don't you worry your pretty little mind 
 people throw rocks at the fire 
 there's nothing i can do, baby, to make it better 
 someday you will... 
 
 wake up and find 
 that i’ve been on 
 but you just keep holding on 
 there's are waiting for the words 
 counting every bird 
 it's you and i had you 
 
 i don't know about you i don't know about you 
 breaking save me. 
 you're too late at you i know is 
 i don't know about you i play and i wasn’t gonna stray 
 swore i’d never come out
