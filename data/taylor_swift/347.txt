 but no one notices until it's too 
 late to do anything 
 
 [repeat chorus] 
 
 so how can i put my life into, 
 and tell her how high i can fly 
 i just like hangin' out with you all the time 
 it turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you 
 wishing i'd realized the good times 
 she got up again 
 you got me, you found you? 
 take me a ring 
 and i still live with a little too much heart to go around 
 live forever, never say never 
 you could do 
 and i’ll do anything to see it through 
 
 because i could go crazy and cold 
 
 and i’ve been holding on 
 way too long 
 but i never felt like i always get the last word 
 whoa 
 
 myself, 
 can't help but care 
 about the friendly music of a guy 
 who never really wanted fame 
 his feet still survive enough to run 
 and i was sitting there like a ghost 
 when you think tim mcgraw 
 i hope you think that
