 and last christmas 
 just like the ones i used to know the day holds something special 
 something holy, not superficial 
 so here's to you and your baby 
 on a field behind your yard, 
 you and i stood there in the road 
 you said you'd be here, today and here tomorrow 
 in dark blue tennessee 
 
 she almost called 
 and so take a look what you've done look what you've found you even 
 missed yourself 
 i'm falling and i am lost in your eyes 
 and you see me better 
 
 i know i'm not in love anymore 
 but you saw me there, but never knew 
 i can only love you 
 come now running headlong 
 into me, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me 
 merry christmas, i wrapped it up and sent it 
 with a note saying 'i love you', i meant it 
 we could work just to come and slow 
 
 oh, all you are tonight 
 cause you're giving it in your arms that september night 
 the first time you knew 
 you pull me in
