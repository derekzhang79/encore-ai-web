 you walk me around

 [verse 1 - kendrick lamar:] 
 hey! i can't take my eyes off of you 
 i was born free 
 wish you could only see, 
 i might see you cry, 
 you're not sorry 
 no, no, no 
 you're like you're been down. 
 don't wanna come down 
 but they take us apart hide it down in your room 
 so i best be driving slow 
 on you, but she snows you 
 she made up your eyes 
 and she'll tease you,
