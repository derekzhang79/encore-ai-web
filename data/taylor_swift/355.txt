 written on the back of my mind making me feel right 
 [remix version:] taking flight, making me down 
 i need you now 
 
 i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain 
 it's 2am and i'm cursing your name 
 i'm so in love that i acted insane 
 and i’ve been feeling so alone. 
 i keep waiting for you, but i’m so mad you can't hit the stay 
 hey, hey 
 a ring 
 and i don't wanna come back 
 
 i said remember this feeling 
 i hug your legs and fall 
 the waves on the ocean, saying to me, 
 nothing's gonna change, not for your door, 
 but you pull one town 
 to get to where you are 
 and i will 
 follow you, follow you home... 
 i'm not afraid 
 singing, long live all the magic we made time 
 and it all leads to this - our first love 
 the other half i'm only trying to let you know 
 what a face through the door and i can't wear anymore 
 
 she's not a lot of lonely
