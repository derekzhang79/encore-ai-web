 why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart? 
 
 it's not unbroken anymore. 
 how do i get it back the way 
 i swear i said, that's when i wake up 
 is a letter that you never read 
 from three summers back 
 it's been waiting for you 
 welcome to new york 
 new soundtrack 
 it's been waiting for you 
 welcome to new york 
 
 it's a thug story now can you see it now? 
 these walls that they put up to hold us back remember that mess 
 
 and i need you like a perfect storm in 
 i thought i had you figured out 
 can't breathe whenever you're around 
 seems like that you live with ghosts (ghosts) 
 you, please take me dancing 
 
 and didn't they mean for this 
 
 and all the things that we wished they would always do? 
 what if i could last forever 
 eh 
 we found wonderland 
 you and i are paintin' your eyes 
 and we were happy 
 
 when it was hard to take, 
 yes,
