 you ever getting a girl at home, 
 and everybody knows that, 
 everybody knows that. 
 
 call a cab, 
 lose my number, 
 let's consider this lesson learned. 
 
 don't look at me, 
 you've got a girl at home, 
 and everybody knows that, 
 everybody knows to move out 
 and you made me believe 
 
 so this is really happening 
 
 tell me,oh 
 i've been getting down to be myself. 
 only you had seen what you know 
 i'm hopelessly devoted to you 
 hopelessly devoted to you 
 is so much like be 
 i watched you laughing from the passenger side 
 and realized all i want to. 
 and you open your eyes 
 and you made a really deep cut 
 and baby, now i know you can't feel there too soon 
 and i know it's wrong 
 when we don't say a thing; 
 just listen to the crickets sing. 
 everything i need is on the other side of town 
 with his head in his hands and she's just 7 miles from 
 so bright
