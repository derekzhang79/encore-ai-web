 i watched him go 
 he said, 
 the way you cuss 
 i wrote your whole world 
 and you're thinking we'll be all that you wanted to find 
 and what do you do when the one 
 who you come on 
 the smokey black nights when you still catch my eye 
 tell them how i hope you shine 
 and every time you look at me 
 and i walk away, say it all 
 it all comes out with you all night 
 burning it down 
 someday when you leave me 
 i bet these memories 
 follow you of innocence and we were sitting there by the water? 
 you put your photo off the dash 
 since the feeling ain’t strong 
 i’ll just move on 
 and leave you 
 say that you wanna be with me too 
 so i'mma stay through it through 
 a long hard week. 
 i bet the bluegrass stained your smile comes out to a perfect day 
 just walk away, say we don’t need this 
 but there’s something so beautiful when i fall alone on a park
