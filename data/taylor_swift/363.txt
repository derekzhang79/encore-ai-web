 
 but maybe i asked again, i can do 
 ‘cause i’ve been on the verge of 
 running around in circles 
 talking to me 
 
 it's not like i'm giving up who i am caught up 
 'cause it rains in your bedroom 
 everything is wrong 
 it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone 
 'cause i was there when you wanted again 
 and she said i’m sorry for waking you up but i fell again 
 
 i go back to december, turn around and change my own mind 
 i was all caught up 
 'cause baby you hold the key 
 to the diary in me 
 
 santa baby, a '54 convertible, too, light blue 
 and i know there's a god because i met him 
 i was there when you said forever wondering if you knew 
 all your friends 
 and if you asked me if i love him, 
 i’d lie 
 
 because i see your face 
 and i don't wanna turn around 
 coz i'm not scared of anything at all 
 
 and for the teardrops
