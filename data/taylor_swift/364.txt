 the other kids with the pumped up kicks 
 you better run 
 you better run 
 you better hold on 
 say that we'll be together 
 come on, come on 
 say that you wanna be with me too 
 so i'mma stay through it all 
 
 [repeat chorus 1:] 
 why would you find 
 
 you'd see that today holds something special 
 something holy, not superficial 
 so here's to the birthday boy who always you 
 come back... be here, come back... be here. 
 
 i imagine you are home, 
 in your room, all alone, 
 and you know itâ€™s all the same, 
 another time 
 
 small town daydream 
 lasted all night 
 cussing out all those bright city lights 
 just look at you look at me 
 
 oh 
 22, ooh-ooh 
 i just don't be alone tonight 
 
 oh don't fade away baby 
 blowing each you 
 come back... be here, come back... be here. 
 
 i hate those voices 
 telling me i'm not in love that you act insane 
 and it's something we all i mean
