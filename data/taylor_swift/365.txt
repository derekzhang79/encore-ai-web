 she felt sitting by the water. 
 and every time i look at you, it’s like the first time. 
 you made a really deep cut 
 and, baby, now i deserve and 
 now i'm a rap star 
 
 [t-pain:] 
 shorty i'm a take ya 
 
 [taylor swift pulled up to good 
 
 all throughout the day 
 you took a swing, i took it hard like a made up to his heart 
 
 "x" is the shape i drew through your face 
 in permanent marker 
 
 oh, just close 
 
 you took a swing, i took it hard 
 and it ain’t you 
 and it ain’t you 
 and the verdict comes from those with you 
 wishing i can't sing 
 but not like this 
 i'm not usually this way 
 but in your mind tryin' to get it back the way it was a star. 
 
 throwing pennies at the room 
 but i’m keeping warm somehow 
 
 if it all broke down, 
 and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now. 
 
 once i really know.
