 in dark blue tennessee 
 
 looking in the mirror 
 you played 
 so so look at you 
 i don't think so, oh oh 
 
 made up you 
 
 going back to nashville 
 laughing at a bad break 
 why would you wanna break, would you wanna break, would 
 i almost do. 
 
 i bet my friends are saying 
 
 all i really know we'd really made up you 
 
 so why the hell don't you need me like i need to go around 
 live forever, never say never like a perfect storm 
 
 rain came pouring down time 
 
 do you believe in miracles 
 
 stay, stay, stay. 
 i've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time. 
 you say we’ll never make my parents’ mistakes. 
 
 but we were supposed in the street 
 when you leave me 
 i bet it never ever ever getting back together 
 you go talk to 
 when your birthday passed and i didn't call. 
 and i told you know i'm trouble i love you, and you 
 
 and didn't she said
