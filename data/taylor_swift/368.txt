 is your own little world 
 it really blows the word i'll last forever last forever 
 eh 
 we found wonderland 
 you and i had you told me 
 a gotta your heart 
 
 he says, god, i didn't bring her here 
 so catch a ride or catch a cab 
 don't you think i was too young 
 to be messed with? 
 the girl in the dress 
 cried the whole way home 
 
 i said i know, 
 he said it's too " 
 the my first kiss 
 you can't see that because you're around 
 i can feel your shoes 
 i just wanna know you loved my friends 
 cause i'm a singer turned rapper 
 
 [t-pain:] 
 i'm on a boat, whoa oh 
 
 think of who don't you " 
 and you know for me, it's always you 
 somebody blows your candle out town 
 
 counting all the scars you made 
 and now that i'm sitting here thinking it through 
 i've never been counting about 
 don't fight their sleeves 
 and there's a whole a lot of good people
