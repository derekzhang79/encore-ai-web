 i might believe you know i would die 
 before i let me, juliet, you'll never go out of style 
 we never go out of style 
 
 you got the keys to me 
 
 when you come back down 
 give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around 
 everybody knows that, 
 uh, uh 
 don't look at me, i just wanna look if you know 
 i'll rock writing from your american old songs 
 
 maybe if you saw me there, but never knew 
 i was enchanted to meet you 
 
 made up you 
 
 oh, oh 
 
 made up you in another try to see it was her 
 she said, he tried but an i had a lot about you and hear the look that's in your eyes 
 
 every single time i come on this show 
 it's really been a while, 
 and i don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down, 
 and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now. 
 
 oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze.
