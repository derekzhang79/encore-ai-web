 
 with a smile, and we walk a few but 
 these days i haven't been crazy to let you come up 
 don't think you need yourself the world 
 and i know you're saying that you'll be here anyway 
 but you're untouchable 
 burning brighter than the sun 
 did you make it a loss 
 you could see it to 
 cause every time you smile, i smile 
 and everything that day 
 had me in the palm of your hand 
 then why'd you have to put down my make-up 
 this time i'm flying free 
 it's my turn to be me 
 
 and they say iâ€™ve always known 
 what i wanted 
 my friends and enemies 
 will tell you did it again 
 i hope you cry getting my r-e-v-e-n-g-e 
 
 so i'm gonna have to listen to my mumma's i told you never mind 
 and i'm not a nice girl 
 
 she died from complications 
 of the things that she's never been there 
 i guess heard you wrong 
 and i always knew this time 
 did you think we'd be fine?
