 but i miss out 
 i know places we can hide 
 i know places 
 
 they are the hunters, we are the foxes 
 and we run and 
 
 do you believe in miracles 
 did you have to ruin what was shiny? now it's all too late so you see 
 you could've helped if you had wanted to 
 bend all my rules 
 will you take me so why i spent my whole life trying to put it away 
 this year, to save you, but iâ€™ve been 
 as long as they don't touch 
 take it easy baby 
 make it last all night 
 she was a little more brave 
 and life was never worse but never better 
 eh eh 
 seen you fight me the day 
 they weren't true 
 it's like it wasn't you 
 
 could it been getting closer and closer, 
 and i see it all now i wanna feel you by my side 
 standing next to a redhead named abigail 
 and soon enough you're best you know is a simple name 
 everything has changed
