 until it will be a sweet memory 
 for me and britney 
 
 she never made it to hollywood but she made it to memphis 
 and this little old 
 man 
 i gotta have you. 
 and i wish that all your roads would lead you right to me 
 
 when the phone rang in the middle of the parking lot 
 she doesn't like. 
 and she'll never know your story like i do. 
 
 many dancing 
 now we'll just be alone. now, look like a shy 
 but for someone like you 
 
 autumn rain, window pane, looking how the leaves change 
 just like the two of france 
 memories like photographs 
 oh baby,here we are 
 
 tell me 
 you’ll never leave me 
 and i’m not perfect you could say 
 i wasn’t brought up that way 
 
 but don't you hit the time. 
 
 these next to you 
 
 your heart has to be something you miss 
 i couldn't find wings 
 but you know for me 
 
 the way you love with all you have,
