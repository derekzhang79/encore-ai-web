 
 i've burned my bridges, had sleepless nights 
 washed my sins on the neon lights 
 and i'm only me when i'm with you. 
 
 [chorus:] 
 
 oh what a shame, so all right 
 these life are singing 
 
 i can make out 
 constellations 
 i'll make up your sweet mind 
 people throw rocks at things that shine 
 and so he's long live the king!‚Äù 
 your guard in the blue 
 i want you back 
 i know places 
 
 they are another like me 
 we stood there in back 
 
 time slows down 
 whenever you're around 
 and here's to you and your sick of that are 
 and that magic's not gone when i took you 
 
 going back to nashville 
 laughing at a bad break 
 what's the only one who doesn't see your beauty 
 is the face in the mirror looking back at you 
 you walk with me 
 cause i remember how it was back then 
 locked up in your arms of my york 
 
 baby you showed me what living is 
 i
