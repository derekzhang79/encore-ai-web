 you could never love you 
 and it ain’t you 
 and it ain’t you 
 and it ain’t you 
 and didn't she says 
 
 mama named her lucky on a good day 
 all this time how could you understand? 
 do you say, 
 
 i put out and help me in 
 and didn't she pray too 
 
 oh, you were riding backwards in a dusty window pane 
 
 angels fly in the air tonight 
 saying wasn't it just like swimmin' out your hands 
 and i'm so there 
 that you see what you're doing to me 
 tell me why.. 
 
 you see these friends that i'm obsessive and crazy 
 [album version line:] that's fine i'll tell you this ain't the best thing that’s ever been mine. 
 
 hold on do you reach out a pickup truck 
 crazy and a little rough 
 running free 
 that’s the closest to a cowboy 
 you’ll see me in the pouring rain 
 and talk to someone i don't know about you 
 but i can't confess 
 was that through the 
 smokey black nights
