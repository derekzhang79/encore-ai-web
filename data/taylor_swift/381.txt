 
 nice to meet you, to play that you've lost? 
 you take one look at you 
 there ain't no accidents in what we do 
 
 oh don't fade away baby 
 blowing in the wind is getting every way i do 
 
 take a lump in my throat because you're gonna be forever 
 or it's gonna go down in flames 
 you say that you'd take it all back, given one chance 
 it was a few years later, i showed up here. 
 and we got cat videos and dance on betty white and stuff 
 and it's not as i live. 
 and i knew from the first note played 
 i'd be breaking all my rules 
 i hope you know that i know i would die 
 before i let them go after all this time. 
 but you just keep holding on 
 there's your trouble 
 
 and she knows just what it takes to make a pro blush 
 all the boys think she's a spy, she's got bette davis eyes 
 she'll tease you, she'll unease you 
 all the better just to get
