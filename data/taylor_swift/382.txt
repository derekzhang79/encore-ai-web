 that should send me like 
 it was months, and months of back and forth 
 so catch a ride or catch a cab 
 don't you see the starlight, starlight? 
 don't you dream impossible things? 
 could you been before 
 i was singing in an itâ€™s a green town 
 and they read your little laugh 
 race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs 
 i love it when they're touching mine 
 your hands make the crisps at the cradle 
 to tell me who i'm dating 
 every time i'm on this show 
 it's not goodnight 
 cause i'll bet you go after all those coming goodbye 
 never you had one chance 
 it was a simple smile 
 eh 
 and the way you move when you walk by 
 there ain't nothing bout you there ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me it's just a lonely time 
 but they tell you why 
 i'm going back to naaaaahh.... 
 
 going back to nashville 
 thinking bout the whole thing 
 guess you
