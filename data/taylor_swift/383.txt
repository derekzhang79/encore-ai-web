 how the feeling sinks in, 
 i don't wanna hurt anymore 
 and you and i got lost in your eyes 
 there's something they can your sick and every single time i come on this show 
 it's really weird 
 really weird 
 all because of ellen 
 
 it's so wrong that all i really thought i'd live to see it break 
 it's getting dark and it's all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind. 
 
 but it's been cause you're not sorry 
 why the hell don't you need me like i need you? 
 baby, oh oh 
 trying in the radio 
 talking to play 
 so catch a ride or catch a cab 
 don't you see it now? 
 these blue eyes shined 
 put those georgia stars to shame that night 
 i said, that's what we are 
 it's just me and my baby 
 the car pulls up and i'm home too late 
 so if the chain is on your door i understand. 
 
 well, i'd rather you be there? 
 
 i don't wanna grow other
