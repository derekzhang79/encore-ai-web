 sometimes i wonder it, we should ever be the sweet day 
 i know you were trouble when you walked in 
 so shame on me now 
 flew me to places i'd never been 
 'til you put me into you 
 give me a photograph to hang along 
 made up you 
 don't think of mine 
 as i'm the guy who plays the mandolin 
 mandolin 
 oh, daddy can i go with you? 
 oh, daddy come up the door and call it head and hope for you 
 i can't help myself. 
 
 myself, 
 can't help the writing on the wall. 
 and realized by the distance in the fall 
 
 i've been picking up the pieces of the fall 
 i can he whispers songs into my window 
 in words 
 on the first few times 
 am i right? 
 it's a thug story now can you get with that? 
 
 hey, i drive and pick up your phone, 
 tell me baby 
 look at me 
 
 and it was enchanting to meet you, 
 all i know since yesterday is everything
