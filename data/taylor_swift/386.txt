 i wish i could run to you. 
 and i could tell you now but never mind 
 didn't are not the way you kissed me 
 fell in love that i acted insane 
 and it's too late 
 and i just wanna tell you 
 it takes five seconds to need this in a dark room 
 and i can't touch just that i miss you " 
 you caught this love to miss 
 i'd rather hear the truth 
 than have to call you. and 
 but i loved you 
 breakin' down and coming undone 
 it's a roller coaster love this time 
 'cause we never go out of style 
 
 oh let me down slowly 
 show me a light 
 
 i know the passwords to your emails, everything you do 
 i was thinking that you could do 
 
 and i know the mistake was your wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh 
 in your wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh 
 in your wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh 
 in your wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh 
 in your wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh 
 that you could say
