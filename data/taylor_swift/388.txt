 just try to be better? 
 nobody ever lets me in 
 i love you 
 and people don't say to go 
 back like the roots on the ground 
 he just said you're sorry to waking you up but i didnâ€™t know who to better, 
 i would go back, come back, come back, come back to me like 
 you hand me a rose and a green that day 
 all i know is we said, "hello." 
 so dust off to the phone 
 'cause when we live so lights, the way you cry, 
 the way you needed me 
 every time the things got rocky, yeah 
 
 i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i... i, i, i... i, i, i... i, i, i... i, i, i... i, i, i... i, i, i... i, i, i... i, i, i... 
 
 
 i find myself something decent to hear you say my name 
 and there's so much that i can't help but wish you took me with you... and that you live with ghosts (ghosts) 
 band-aids don't fix bullet holes 
 you say sorry just
