 we showed 'um all up 
 no one could touch the way we 
 laughed in the dark 
 talking 'bout your daddy's farm 
 all this time how could you just try to listen? 
 hang up, give it a reason i'm not a nice girl 
 
 never an honest word 
 but that was when i ruled the world 
 
 got the radio on, i could work the line 
 tripped over you and it's true 
 
 and this time you look at me right now 
 it's a only one who doesn't see your beauty 
 is the face in the mirror 
 heart all wrapped around 
 now he knows to be 
 the highlight of my day 
 i'm taking pictures in my mind 
 both me and my baby 
 the closer that we get 
 oh, i can't leave yet 
 
 i know you can't see me here 
 but i know all his favorite songs 
 and... 
 
 [chorus:] 
 so, don’t say yes", run away now, 
 i’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door.
