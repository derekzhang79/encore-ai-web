 why are people not before you even knew me 
 that i would be the that i didn't get this where was hard to school 
 he never talked about a look what you've ever seen, oh 
 
 and all i wanna do 
 turn the time to memorize me: 
 my night 
 and i dream from our girl on a cover but you stood there with me in the doorway 
 my hands shake 
 i'm not usually this way 
 but your close loud 
 ooh, look at you now, my things at your place. 
 you learn my window 
 i keep going back over things and i won't tell you 
 
 when i'm mad at all 
 and you made me your own 
 now you mail back my things and call my all my mind when you say its 
 oh it's too late for you and your smile 
 that could light up this whole town. 
 and i won't be alone tonight 
 
 i... i used to watch you sleep 
 and a half 
 
 wish you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares 
 but
