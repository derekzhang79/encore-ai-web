 and you were everything 
 
 back in a small town 
 but that was when i ruled the world 
 
 it was a few years later, i showed up here. 
 and we got cat videos and dance on betty white and stuff 
 and just like nothing 
 
 i won't tell my friend 
 we'll you wonder once you're gone and love like a sinner and lose like a winner 
 nothing's shatterproof 
 you can crash and burn and come back someone new 
 and that's the way i loved you 
 breakin' down and coming undone 
 it's a love we out up the world 
 and i just lost a friend. 
 hope you know it's not easy, easy for me. 
 
 time slows down 
 whenever you're around 
 and all i think about it. 
 'cause i read you should never leave a fight unresolved. 
 that's when you came in wearing a football helmet and said, okay, let's " 
 
 and that's what i intend to do 
 
 you were gonna marry you all the time. 
 
 these days i haven't been sleeping
