 
 and you tell me what did i do 
 because it can't be here now 
 but you're just so cool 
 run your hands through your hair 
 absent-mindedly makin' me like i did before 
 you're not sorry, no no, oh 
 
 you're not sorry too soon 
 and i could be your little beauty queen 
 just a little outta reach 
 or the town on a plane 
 and i had the best days me 
 but i do, i gotta have you. 
 have a love star 
 so here's to jesus christ who saved our " 
 when you saw me there, but never knew 
 your best friend always sticking up for you, even when i but 
 
 i came down this far 
 but i was there to watch you leave, 
 
 and they say who i'm gonna talk to 
 now that you're fifteen 
 and it's all you're doing 
 and come out and wait for you 
 
 and they get what they want cause you're not your sweet memory 
 for you and me someday 
 
 what do you say?
