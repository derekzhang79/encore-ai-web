 when i said, i'll never let you " 
 when all those shadows to clear. 
 
 she's finally well enough to travel 
 doctor says she's in the clear 
 since the beginning of the year 
 and you're thinking we'll be a sweet day 
 i just feel 
 there's just not much 
 you come a little closer 
 
 may your days 
 and you are everything to me 
 
 it just all so out, 
 and they said, when the one 
 who means the most to you 
 
 but now there's nowhere to hide 
 if i could write on the wall 
 i wrote your name you tell me about your eyes 
 and i confess, babe, 
 in my dreams you're touching my face 
 and asking me about " 
 look at who and could say 
 i don’t want to jinx my luck 
 i’ve had the one of waiting 
 wondering if i was there loving you and wished them all your roads 
 i think you're on your favorite night light 
 
 all i do
