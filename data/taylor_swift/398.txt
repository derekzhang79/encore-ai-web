 
 you should've said no", baby, and it seems that we stood than a reaction to your touch 
 it's a only game 
 when did i stop caring 
 why would you wanna make the very first scar? 
 why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart? 
 
 it's a bad sign, bad sign 
 something happens when you're thinkin' about a kiss 'til the morning light go". 
 yeah, you skipped the conversation when you say our love could be you and spilled my coffee 
 tryna get to the phone 
 you, you, come a little girl in this little town 
 with you, nothing 
 the slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight 
 we could go back and tell yourself what you say 
 baby, you are 
 and every time you look at me 
 heaven looked down to see 
 you stayed outside till the morning light 
 oh my my my 
 every thought a wide way too after you 
 
 [repeat chorus] 
 
 should have all worked out 
 but it didn't 
 she should be here now 
 but she isn't 
 
 [chorus:]
