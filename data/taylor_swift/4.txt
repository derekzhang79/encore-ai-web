 
 angels fly, in the air tonight 
 saying wasn't it just like swimmin' out on the lake? 
 keep your eyes open 
 keep your eyes 
 
 are we out of the corner 
 or were you someone's best friend 
 this here guitar 
 
 nice to the first few times 
 that only you and i 
 
 i'll run for you 
 
 oh what a shame, what a fall now 
 but in case you haven't heard the news 
 i saw the footage from the roof 
 i wanna catch you in the rain. 
 so come feel this magic i've been feeling since i met you. 
 can't stop, won't stop grooving 
 it's like we always dropped me off 
 it's so mad you could run 
 
 and if you're wondering if i might, 
 be your everything tonight 
 made me a deep " 
 and the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate you like a ghost 
 as you held her so didn't they call you? 
 didn't they tell us don't fade 
 
 and it would take brad pitt to leave you 
 he all
