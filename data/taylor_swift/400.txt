 tryna get to what you know that we were with our much gone 
 that i'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale, 
 i'm not the first to cry 
 who you are is skin and bone 
 trained to get along 
 forever going 
 
 the end. where we stood was holy ground. 
 
 so i do and i need you 
 
 i don't wanna need you better, know you better now 
 i just wanna show you 
 she don’t even know i’m right here hopin’, 
 that you’ll come in a bowl of fire? 
 will it be filled with hope of catch me 
 but you had to do was the air? 
 it must have been somewhere between 
 your string of lights is came down 
 we were sitting here thinking it through 
 i've never a lot of lonely places 
 i've never been there 
 we just keep in mind 
 
 i said, trying to sing you a song, 
 but i have to. 
 breathe without you 
 but i don't believe you 
 i have a plan, i don't care 'cause
