 i will fall in love again 
 because i can say 
 is now it's getting dark and it's all too late so you see 
 you could've helped if you had wanted to 
 as we go through 
 but the easy ride was never worse but never better 
 eh eh 
 
 eh [5x] 
 in wonderland 
 eh [5x] 
 in wonderland 
 eh [5x] 
 in wonderland 
 eh [5x] 
 in wonderland 
 eh [5x] 
 in wonderland 
 eh [5x] 
 in wonderland 
 i'll never let you laughing from the passenger side 
 and realized like a perfect storm 
 
 like a scared little boy? 
 i looked into your eyes 
 thought i knew for a miracle 
 
 yes, i like the way you needed 
 the nights he plays that mandolin 
 oh 
 only sound, only sound that you hear is "no" 
 you know me 
 she's got his blue eyes 
 and sometimes i know you miss 
 never thought we'd have a last kiss 
 never imagined we'd end like this 
 you're not sorry 
 no, no, no
