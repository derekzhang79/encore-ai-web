 thought that never grow up, iâ€™m not crazy and 
 you better run 
 you better run 
 you better run 
 you better run 
 faster than my bullet 
 
 you were watching this chance to say this is 
 let's put me and you 
 
 autumn rain, window pane, looking in the nice " 
 i hope the sun shines 
 and it's a bad sign, bad sign 
 something happens when i'm mad, mad, mad. 
 but i can't help thinking this " 
 
 i have been looking in, trying to read your mind 
 give you the benefit of the doubt, every single time 
 and thankin' things you didn't notice to you. 
 and it's even a song it brings along 
 everybody saying 
 who's that guy who plays the mandolin 
 mandolin 
 
 lay down your guns 
 too weak to run 
 nothing can harm you here 
 come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here 
 the lights are so much last world 
 with the girls of us we can't get back 
 
 cause i owe my friends ten dollars and
