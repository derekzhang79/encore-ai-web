 i can't take my eyes off of their mind. 
 
 so in love that you act insane 
 and that's the way i loved me 
 i guess all that's dead and gone and passed tonight 
 
 just close your eyes 
 the sun is going down 
 we could work it out somehow 
 but if you need be 
 i know you wouldn't have told nobody if i could play it again 
 even when it's not as young, but we’re still beautiful and free 
 oh, oh 
 she was always so strong 
 i’ll just wait for the day i stop pretending 
 that i'm really ok when i'm not 
 i want to be where... 
 
 [chorus:] 
 that i'm really ok when i'm not 
 i wanna stay right here in this passenger's seat 
 you put your eyes are there 
 
 [chorus:] 
 the simple things in life are got bette davis eyes 
 she'll turn the music on you, you loved me 
 i guess that you are 
 so you might have him but haven't love people to change your mind
