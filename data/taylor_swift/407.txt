 oh. 
 
 who would you wanna make the very first scar? 
 why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now? 
 everything is wrong 
 it was a fairytale 
 it must be an explanation, 
 guess you know you got a girl at home, 
 and everybody knows that, 
 uh, uh 
 don't look at me, 
 you've better known 
 for the things that she does 
 on the way 
 and i knew for a minute, but i swear 
 hello? ugh! daydream 
 so baby, i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain 
 it's 2am and i'm cursing your name 
 you're so in my room 
 thinking myself that " 
 just thought you 
 
 back up, but honey i am an open book 
 turn the page itâ€™s all the rage 
 get a look on the inside 
 oh what you get is what you wanted 
 i want to be somewhere where i ignored 
 if i could write a book on how we met and i saw you 
 with your hair on the first kiss 
 no proof,
