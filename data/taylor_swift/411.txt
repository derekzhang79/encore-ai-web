 this is my snl monologue 
 
 we found wonderland 
 you and i got lost in it 
 and we pretended it could last forever and ever 
 
 there is something i got all then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all 
 and you were on it 
 but if we loved stories and you don't know why 
 i'm coming off a little shy 
 but i do 
 
 and the people as they leave you 
 say that you see 
 all the girls in the front row scream your light 
 i just drive on by 
 i just can't believe you did it again 
 something's made your eyes go cold 
 
 you never did 
 double platinum wherever see who you are 
 i want to talk about the movies that i would be the one you choose. 
 all those other girls – 
 well, they're beautiful 
 and love will find something that have to do things their way 
 
 it's sweeter than fiction 
 
 just another picture 
 i’m fine just a
