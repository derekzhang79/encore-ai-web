 face to face but you're just in your eyes 
 thought i knew you for a minute, but i don't anymore 
 and we were happy 
 i could go back to every laugh, 
 but i don't care 'cause right now you're all so much 
 and didn't they pray too? 
 
 i don't miss those rude interruptions 
 
 and they say i’ve always known 
 what i wanted 
 my friends and enemies 
 will tell you it’s true 
 
 do you believe in miracles 
 please take me dancing 
 got this here for you 
 and i know it's wrong 
 i don't wanna lose your face 
 
 all i know is we said, "hello." 
 and your eyes look like coming home 
 all i know 
 oh i'm just a girl 
 oh i'm just a girl 
 oh i'm just a nice girl 
 
 she died from complications 
 of the things that i misread 
 
 so babe if you know everything, be fine long 
 i’ve been lovin' you for what you think 
 she's not a saint 
 and she's been living
