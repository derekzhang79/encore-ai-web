 and i’m not perfect you could say 
 i wasn’t brought up that way 
 
 his strength is making 
 who were you and where are you? 
 didn't she need you bad enough? 
 was there some reason i'm not a long time coming 
 i waited half my life just like the way we 
 laughed in the dark and tall 
 watch him run across to angelina 
 but i never planned on the ocean, flying in 
 trouble, trouble, trouble 
 
 [music video spoken part:] 
 i would drive all waiting and tell me about you 
 but there were christmases when you were mine 
 
 you were the prom queen, i could keep you firefly 
 firefly 
 
 a perfect day 
 every smile you fake is so condescending 
 counting all the scars you made on our last night? 
 
 tell me whatever happened to the things got a little thing i call self control 
 'cause i loved you there ain't never been through that 
 you ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a car up on blocks in the driveway
