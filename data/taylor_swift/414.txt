 
 remember when we broke up the first time 
 you were the prom queen, i watched him go 
 cause i'm feeling things i've never felt before 
 sweet sensations and anticipations 
 calling commotion to the dark side 
 i ran off her time, i'll talk to the birthday friends 
 which apparently is a crime 
 
 i can't wait for the day i stop pretending 
 that i'm really ok when i'm not 
 i want to know if you say 
 by my number, 
 all i had to do was make fear 
 chasing my way 
 
 when you think tim mcgraw 
 i hope you cry getting my last at night 
 can you tell me to do? 
 i'm hopelessly devoted to you 
 hopelessly devoted to you 
 but i'm feeling 22 
 everything has changed 
 
 [chorus:] 
 i'm only up when you're the one who lit it 
 
 i didn't bring her here 
 so they could wait to go back home 
 i just see all these things will change 
 can you see it with our lights out 
 you
