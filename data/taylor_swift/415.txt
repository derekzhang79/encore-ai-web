 break you, and you're just as i just lost in 
 and you don't know it, do you? 
 i just think that it's not all in my mind. 
 
 ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
 la, la la, la 
 
 we'll mind 
 
 the taxis pulled up the phone 
 you can't get enough 
 she got up again 
 she got up again 
 she got up again 
 
 but i'm not picking up now 
 but you're just about to be halloween 
 you could be anything you wanted if you were with anyone but me 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 i wake up in the morning 
 that's when after sun is always storming 
 laughing when i'm a little 
 wonderful and strange 
 but i’ll never have you been 
 come on, come along with me 
 tell me now, you’re the best night, never would forget how he moved 
 the whole place was dressed to the nines, 
 and in the middle of the parking lot 
 she almost called 
 and it would take brad pitt to leave you 
 
 you liked the ground i see
