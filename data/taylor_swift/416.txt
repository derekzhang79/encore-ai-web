 i wish you would 
 
 say a single vow 
 
 i gotta ask the call your mind 
 we are the kings and the beautiful eyes 
 and i confess, babe, 
 in my dreams you're touching my face 
 and bring on all the pretenders 
 i'm not afraid 
 singing, long live all the mountains we moved 
 i should say, hey, by the way... 
 
 [chorus:] 
 i was barely breathing 
 i was crawling home 
 well, it's a scene 
 
 and we know it's so we should talk about it. 
 'cause i read home 
 i never had a lesson so sweet 
 you wanna be by with sweet tea and god's graces 
 you can love like a sinner and lose like a winner 
 nothing's shatterproof 
 you can crash and burn and come back someone new 
 and that's the way i loved you 
 breaking down and coming undone 
 it's a roller coaster kinda rush 
 and i never knew i could feel that strong 
 i've been an awful good girl, santa baby 
 so hurry down the chimney
