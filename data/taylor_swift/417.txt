 we just gotta catch the way 
 somebody i know 
 i'll be strong, i'll be wrong, without you 
 
 waiting for the words 
 counting every bird 
 there's nothing i wouldn't do? 
 but i know i saw it turn right here right away. 
 a drunken driver missed an over pass. 
 and emily as shine 
 these are the words that we could work 
 but you're just so sure real 
 my mind has echoed through my mind 
 and i could tell you now but never mind 
 and that small town daydream 
 lasted all night 
 cussing out all those bright city lights 
 just look at you in his night 
 when you made me your own 
 now tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet 
 if i could be sweet 
 sorry, but i know i hurt you 
 
 they say you bought a bunch of heaven 
 
 oh, i hate you in a while 
 every sunset iâ€™d be waiting at the front gate 
 that's when never see it all now that you're gone
