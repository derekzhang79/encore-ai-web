 
 and i don't wanna come back 
 i wish you were right here, right now, it's all good. 
 i wish you knew, 
 so here you are at my door, 
 [gary lightbody:] this is the last time i'm asking you this, 
 put my name at the top of your list, 
 this is the worthwhile fight 
 love is a ruthless game 
 unless you play it good and right 
 these are the hands of fate 
 you're my achilles heel 
 this is the golden age 
 when i said, i'll never forget you as long as i was sweet 
 i know places we can hide 
 i know places 
 and i feel like coming undone 
 it's a roller coaster love going 
 
 and they tell you that youâ€™re lucky. 
 keep your feet ready 
 heartbeat steady 
 keep your eyes open [4x] 
 
 everybody's waiting for you to break down 
 everybody's watching to see the fallout 
 even when you're sleeping, sleeping 
 keep your ey-eyes 
 
 keep your feet ready 
 heartbeat steady 
 keep your eyes open 
 
 keep your eyes
