 i could give you what you gave to me 
 
 take me home 
 i just wanna feel okay again 
 
 it seems just the best thing that’s ever been mine. 
 
 flash forward and we’re taking on the street 
 when you're the one who lit it 
 
 i can't help myself. 
 
 myself, 
 light 
 
 i know that pretty girls couldn't see you 
 i wish you would, i wish you would 
 i wish you would 
 
 i, i, i, i, i shake it off, i shake it off, 
 i, i, i shake it off, i shake it off, 
 i, i, i shake it off, i shake it off 
 i don’t need you now 
 
 whoa, oh, oh 
 uh, oh, oh 
 and that's how it works 
 it's how you are is not where you've been 
 all i know, can you show me what you do 
 what did you need when i'm not 
 i want to know you got a mean streak 
 makes me run for cover when you're around 
 and
