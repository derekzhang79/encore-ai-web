 
 put me as plain new together 
 i'll catch you to the moon 
 iâ€™ll pray for you and me someday 
 what do you say? 
 
 oh 
 
 you pack a suitcase, take a picture of you in his office downtown 
 and you don't know, what you need 
 
 if you ever leave i'll be crawling back for more 
 and if i drive away, drive out 
 can't breathe whenever you're gone 
 can't go back, i'm haunted 
 
 stood there and you got me, i miss you bad 
 but i know i know it's not easy, easy for me. 
 
 if i had a reason or a simple goodbye 
 
 here you are, two steps ahead and staying by the staircase 
 begging you, please don't " 
 and i could tell you now but never you 
 i want you please let me, 
 you're not sorry 
 no, no, no 
 you're not sorry 
 and you tell me that you love me 
 need me,tell me 
 (baby) 
 that this is really happening 
 oh,oh,baby
