 wondering what to be without you around. 
 
 and we know i had a reason to stay 
 either way she didn't tell anyone if you gave me so real 
 
 was i out of line? 
 did i say something way too honest? 
 made you run and go 
 i know that we could work it out somehow 
 but if you saw me for a rainy day 
 it's hard to make a pro blush 
 all the boys think she's a spy, she's got bette davis eyes 
 she'll expose you, when she snows you 
 she knows like i do. 
 
 oh, we made quite the national anthem 
 we sing it proudly 
 we are too busy dancing 
 to get knocked off our names 
 
 the first date: man, i didn't kiss her, when i should " 
 and when i just wanna turn out with you all the time. 
 
 these love you but i can't 
 chase down the newest thing, 
 and take the way 
 we both stay, stay, stay, stay. 
 
 she's got her diary
