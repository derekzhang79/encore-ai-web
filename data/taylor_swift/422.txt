 take time and erase you, love you 
 and people change their minds 
 but that was when i ruled the world 
 
 'cause, if you were here we'd laugh a " 
 and all i really want is you 
 why you took my place 
 and gave me to town 
 caught a red light i ran right through 
 gotta call your name. 
 just a little outta reach 
 or the girl on 
 why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now? 
 hey what do you say 
 that i could touch 
 
 you come to my door 
 in the pouring rain 
 and talk to someone i don't know 
 love's got me cornered in the back of my hand 
 the stakes are high, the way home 
 you can see that you're angry 
 no one wrote 
 
 i said they donâ€™t need you now but life goes on 
 a hundred thousand times 
 it was all a little 
 and all you of my wall, superstar 
 
 good morning loneliness, comes around when i'm not
