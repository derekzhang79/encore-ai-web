 all i know is we said, "hello." 
 and your first kiss makes your life love you for me 
 i've been an awful good girl, santa baby 
 so hurry down the chimney tonight 
 
 santa, honey, there's one more thing 
 for you but i don't anymore 
 
 and i donâ€™t need you now 
 
 come back, come back, come back, come back to me like 
 you could, you the goodbye 
 
 i don't need you but i do, 
 i never talked about me and you got lost in your eyes 
 you made a really deep cut 
 and, baby, now i'm not so sure 
 
 so he drives down to 
 that principles office 
 and been like a scared little boy? 
 i been there 
 if i remember it all, all, all... a lot of good people in an empty room and see who wins 
 let's talk about what you did with her, 
 get back to me 
 
 this love is good, this love is glowing in the dark 
 these hands had to let it go free
