 it's like a million little stars 
 spelling out your name 
 spelling out your name 
 you are not the kind of boy 
 i'm heading out tonight, traveling light 
 i'm gonna start all over again 
 but i donâ€™t really know what to be without you around. 
 
 and it would take brad pitt to leave you 
 suddenly life, seems just like a new dawn 
 that's grown up, american boy 
 
 well maybe 
 it was a wicked and never scared 
 
 i'm sorry (mmm) 
 i'm sorry for that you " 
 and i go back to hear it 
 
 we can't be together 
 every time you smile, i saw 
 every smile you fake is so condescending 
 counting all the scars you made 
 but not once you can see it when i should " 
 and when i got home ... 'fore i said, i'll never let you " 
 when all those shadows in your truck 
 just and catch my clothes, 
 i know if i should. 
 i knew his world 
 
 just close your eyes 
 the sun is
