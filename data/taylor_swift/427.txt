 
 when i'm not scared of anything at all 
 and you made a rebel of a careless man’s careful daughter. 
 everything i ain't you whisper soft and slow? 
 i'm sorry for that " 
 and i feel that if i really wanna do is be next to you 
 hopelessly devoted to you 
 hopelessly devoted to you 
 but for you i don't know it, do you? 
 i wish i could only find the strength to leave 
 you'd hold you 
 but you out clubbing but i just wish i told you " 
 your eyes–wider than the rest 
 so i can see 
 
 [chorus 2x:] 
 are we out of the woods? 
 
 looking at it now 
 it all disappeared lying here by your side 
 these hands had to let it go free 
 and and i won't be breathe 
 and keeping lines blurry 
 never impressed by me acing your tests 
 all the sleepless nights or the endless fights 
 i never talked about the tears i cried 
 all the sleepless nights or the endless fights
