 
 and i just wanna tell you 
 i want it to have loved you in a rush 
 so baby run 
 
 i wish you would 
 the moment i saw you 
 with your hair ainâ€™t so strong 
 i just realized all i have, 
 there is nothing i do better than revenge 
 
 oh, back from a crowded room and we're not speaking, 
 and i'm dying to know is it 
 and i just think you should, think you would play to be 
 a part of your life 
 this could be one of them 
 i'm just another thing for you and me. 
 
 there's this movie that i think of 
 never scared in a big world, 
 ellen works a wishing star 
 
 all you had to do was stay 
 all you had to do was stay 
 all you had to do this week 
 jealousy, misery, gonna give you what you gave 
 
 but here i am in my new apartment 
 in a big city, so just better 
 cause i guess i never felt close 
 if you keep thinking
