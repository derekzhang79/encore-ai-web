 i shake it off, i shake it off, i shake it off, i shake it off 
 
 long live the walls we crashed through 
 how the kingdom lights shined just for me and my baby 
 the world is spinning round 
 cause it's worked each time you leave somebody to go 
 and all i really wanna do is be next to me like this 
 i tried to take the road less traveled by 
 oh i don't wanna grow up, stay 
 we tell me, how's just too 
 so i'mma stay through the hands 
 
 and i feel you forget me like i need you? 
 are you out up this way? 
 see me nervously pulling at my life 
 face to face but the cycle ends to the movies 
 and you're close i don't touch 
 you go i hope you don't save some other girl 
 hey yeah whatâ€™s the word on you 
 lay down your guns 
 too weak to run 
 
 and if you ever leave i'll be crawling back for more 
 and all i wanna do 
 is forget it
