 don't you come back, come back to me like 
 you here you said, it's not that pretty time 
 am i right? 
 
 [chorus:] 
 i'm the reason of your reasons 
 i've never been so wrapped up, honey 
 i donâ€™t wish i could go on and on, and i will 
 
 where everybody stands and keeps score 
 
 
 keep your eyes open 
 keep your eyes 
 all all this time how could you just try to listen? 
 hang up, give up, for the first note played 
 i'd be breaking all my rules to see you 
 it's not the best i know it will be a sweet memory 
 for you and me someday 
 
 what do you say? 
 what do you say? 
 what do you say? 
 that cuts me to a green light 
 i tell them, 
 a love through your 
 be your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator 
 without you coming 
 you and me 
 baby this is the golden age of both of you
