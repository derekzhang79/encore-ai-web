 right now, it's all good. 
 i wish you were right here, right now, it's all good. 
 i wish i knew, 
 but the whole time i'm wishing he was mine 
 
 and you'll never see, i wanna know anything i- (what?) 
 i can't believe you made me, 
 sit in a nice dress, 
 staring at the sunset, babe 
 red lips and rosy cheeks 
 say you'll see me like a promise. 
 so casually cruel in the name of being honest. 
 i'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying around the light in 
 permanent marker 
 
 i found that picture 
 i had to catch my breath 
 when i saw you there across the room 
 face to face but the fun i've missed 
 don't try to hide my tears. 
 the secrets or my fears when i wake up in your arms was something so i don't know 
 love's got me tangled, tired me too 
 no sign of a wall, sign of wall, 
 spinning me around 
 and baby all i know is you held the door 
 
 and we'll tell
