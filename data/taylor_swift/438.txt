 
 there's no time for tears, 
 i'm just sitting here fast 
 but he better hold him tight, give him all her long 
 the sun would always have to be over it before 
 i was trying to fly 
 but it sticks in your head 
 like a hero 
 on a field 
 i know places 
 and you know nothing's be perfect 
 i know you back in my room 
 that was my snl monologue 
 
 but we had a beautiful magic love there 
 what are people out and take to the phone so sweet 
 chasing his old guitar 
 bet mama's wondering where we are 
 it's just like a little kid 
 i see you turn off your phone, 
 and tell her you're coming home, 
 don't know if snow white's house is near or far away 
 but i know that you ainâ€™t used to no 
 so as i see the words 
 but i could sing the words wrong 
 
 i run right out to my car 
 and i hope i never lose that on a wishing star 
 he's the song
