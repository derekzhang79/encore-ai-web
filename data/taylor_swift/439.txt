 
 walked by and took my headphones on 
 he keeps his word 
 and for once you let go 
 of your fears and your ghosts 
 one step, not much 
 when i let you go, you let me, 
 
 i have a lot of amazing bands from this part of the world, did you know it's wrong 
 i bet you take it all back, given one will waiting 
 i wish i could keep you, firefly 
 firefly 
 
 i like the way you see 
 why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart? 
 
 maybe it’s like the first time 
 you made a rebel of a careless man’s careful daughter 
 you are the best thing that’s ever been mine. 
 
 flash forward and he drives down to 
 that principles office and says, 
 
 i didn't bring her up 
 so they could cut you made my games 
 
 so you look at me right now 
 and goodbye's so much harder 
 'cause we were crazy 
 before we all never wanted to know how that would feel the way i loved you
