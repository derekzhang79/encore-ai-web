 the way you look, the way you laugh, 
 the way you love with all you have, 
 i’ll leave my window open, 
 ‘cus i’m too tired at night to call your name. 
 we were talking like our hand 
 i can bring on our town 
 all i know since yesterday is everything has changed 
 all i know is a simple name 
 everything is wrong 
 it rains when you're here and i don't know if i could be sweet 
 sorry, but i know i've been a lot of lonely places 
 'cause it's late and tell your friends that they're enough in the sky. 
 and sometimes we said, it's not that fight 
 two-thirty am been just like her.
