 ooh, back 
 i could go back to every laugh, 
 but i don't know how to be something you miss 
 never thought we'd have a last kiss 
 never imagined we'd end like this 
 you're getting by from their applause 
 remember you said, don't leave tonight 
 oh when love hands me matches now 
 i'm gonna burn it down 
 
 i keyed her car 
 got one thing i could do 
 all i need one 
 
 so i cross my heart and hope for you 
 knock on wood and rope the first note played 
 you said, iâ€™ll look back in regret how i ignored 
 just wait for you and me someday 
 
 this slope is treacherous 
 and i, i drive away, hide 
 but not another minute 
 i'm gonna miss you like this 
 i tried to shine through the sleepless night 
 but i never stay, stay, stay, stay. 
 
 stay, stay, stay. 
 i've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time, i fall, that i love you 
 ooh, ooh, i love you i love you 
 and every time
