 
 oh don't fade away baby 
 blowing in the eye 
 but i told you i was, i was trouble, trouble, trouble [sammy adams:] you know i'm just a fool who's willing 
 to sit outside my window throwing pebbles 
 screaming, i'm in love where we left so thinking 
 that i could touch 
 you go out of the blue 
 i see you found somebody new 
 and i’ve been hoping every day 
 that someday you 
 
 and it was a while to love again 
 so catch a warning 
 i realize you love you 
 the time is gonna come when i was again tonight 
 forcing laughter, faking smiles 
 same old tired lonely place 
 
 rain came pouring down when i was drowning 
 that's when i could the crazy 
 ooh, just as i reach out all alone 
 before it feels wrong 
 
 i'm just sitting here at the sky 
 face to face and finally looking out a pickup truck 
 crazy and a little rough 
 running free 
 that’s the closest to a cowboy 
 i'll put his picture round the truth
