 i thought it was a star. 
 
 diving off into the deep end, 
 honestly believe you'd be there, 
 let's see if you here me 
 and i just drive on by, drive on, drive and summer 
 we'd been here, 
 he donâ€™t even know where i start. 
 
 talk to yourself, talk to the tears, 
 talk to the man with the reasons why, 
 and let me know what you find. 
 
 she died from complications 
 of a oh 
 something i can't see the smile i'm faking 
 but it wasn't i should be leaving

 it's sweeter than, sweeter 
 sweeter than fiction

 come back... be here, come back... be here. 
 
 you say you're 'bout to cry. 
 i know your favorite songs,
