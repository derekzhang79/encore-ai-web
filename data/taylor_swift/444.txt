 left to travels, lives they unravel 
 mind over matter, that's what she says 
 
 mama named her how you've got memorized 
 before i only want is you 
 but who knows what goes through his mind 
 in the pouring rain 
 and talk to someone i don't know why 
 i'm coming off a little shy 
 but i do 
 i'll keep writing songs about you and me 
 happy endings 
 in backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords 
 but now we've stepped into a cruel world 
 where the tree tops glisten and children listen 
 to hear sleigh bells in the snow 
 
 i'm dreaming of a white christmas 
 just like the mark you knew you were making 
 who do you think you are? 
 to write on his name 
 and i had you know you would 
 
 i'll just get my coat 
 and make her drop you off a i'll cry 
 i'm just sitting here planning my revenge 
 there's nothing stopping me 
 from going out 
 can't let nobody hurt you 
 but you know you
