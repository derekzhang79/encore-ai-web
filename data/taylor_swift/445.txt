 you took my place 
 and gave me a room 
 and i go out of style 
 
 oh 
 
 and i don't wanna turn around 
 coz i'm not scared of anything at all 
 and you would know what's down this road, i'm just walking 
 trying to see through the rain 
 and i won't be alone tonight 
 
 me and i got that good girl faith and a first little family 
 watches 
 the walls we crashed through 
 how the kingdom lights shined just for me 
 the way you kiss, the way you cry, 
 the way you needed me 
 every time the things got rocky, yeah 
 
 i just wanna show you 
 all the better just to please you 
 she's precocious 
 and she knows just what it takes to make a pro blush 
 all the boys think she's a spy, she's got bette davis eyes 
 she'll expose you, when she snows you 
 she knows you, i could go back to all the things you if i died, died for you 
 
 oh 
 i might fall in love again
