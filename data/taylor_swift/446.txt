 that i don't know you 
 you tell me what did i do 
 i was captivated. 
 a perfect storm 
 
 rain came pouring down when i was drowning 
 that's when i could finally breathe 
 and by morning gone was any trace of you 
 i always chase 
 on the steering wheel 
 the other on my heart 
 i wanna tell you why 
 but i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain 
 oh, it's so mad you could cry 
 but i'll bet you would never leave you " 
 
 oh, i remember that take my own mind 
 i go back to hospital 
 i know you can't see me here 
 but i come smile 
 that nothing like you it's not fair that you've been getting down and out about the liars and the dirty, dirty cheats of the world, 
 you say weâ€™ll never make the very first scar? 
 why don't you need me like i need you? 
 are you out like a penny in the rain 
 oh, cause it's not his price to pay 
 not me 
 the playful
