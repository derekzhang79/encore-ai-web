 
 ooh, ooh, i love you i knew the blame is on me 
 take the towel getting cold 
 and everybody's here, except from you 
 
 and i just wanna know you, know you like me 
 you were riding backwards in a dusty 
 it's like it wasn't you 
 
 he said the way she good 
 
 all the truth 
 than have to say goodbye 
 i'd rather hear the truth 
 oh i still see the light 
 i'll put his picture down 
 and maybe get some sleep tonight. 
 
 'cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar 
 the lights is your own 
 once that's when i learned the dirt roads 
 and i could tell you now but never mind 
 and i could go back to every laugh, 
 but i don't care 'cause right now you're mine 
 it's all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind. 
 
 but iâ€™ll leave you 
 even not the first to cry 
 i'm not the first to cry 
 i'm not so sure
