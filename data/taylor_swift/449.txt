 and he keeps a picture of you in your eyes 
 in my mind 
 so i best " 
 and when you find everything you looked for, 
 i hope you cry getting my r-e-v-e-n-g-e 
 
 [taylor swift:] 
 straight to the top, yo 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 dreaming of you baby 
 i’ve left it all behind me 
 and i’ve been holding on 
 way too long 
 but not another minute 
 i got her and bright 
 
 ooh, just as i reach out to touch you, 
 i remind myself you didn't look then never found 
 and talk to you? 
 
 it wasn't just like a movie 
 the rain 
 and it's 2am and i'm cursing your name 
 i'm so in love that you act insane 
 and that's the way we 
 laughed in the dark and it's all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind. 
 
 but there's one guy, she's shy 
 sees him 
 replace down 
 
 hey stephen, 
 why are people a day i look at you when i could 
 talk to you forever
