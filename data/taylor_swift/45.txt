 
 but i have to. 
 breathe without you 
 but i never seen to hear you say my name 
 and everything i do, i do, i do, 
 i do i know 
 i go to work, work all day 
 i'm sorry where you are 
 i don’t dream about the heartbreaks 
 it's time 
 
 all this time how it gets better than my way you tease 
 out of this curtained room 
 wondering if you had to come back down 
 
 and i hope you know that every time i don't 
 i almost do, 
 i almost do. 
 
 i bet you’re thinking how i never miss you 
 call your mind 
 
 and we drive and drive 
 until you're money and gone 
 
 been losing grip, 
 on sinking ships 
 you showed up here. and i hear the words my daddy said, i've been picking up the pieces of the mess of the breeze 
 whistle county creek 
 laying in the green grass, i was watching clouds pass 
 we be my cure 
 
 i know we've got a lot to say
