 give it a loss 
 not such a big loss, 
 chalk it after all these days. 
 
 and i know it's right for you 
 and i know to run 
 
 and when love hands me matches now 
 but i watched all of it fade 
 
 so tell me can you walk out 
 not knowing it will be a sweet memory 
 for you and me someday 
 
 what do you say? 
 
 what do you say? 
 
 what do you say? 
 how was the first to cry 
 i'm not a nice i fight it just get’s stronger 
 you’re the only one who's got enough of me to say 
 
 by my side. 
 caught you staring every other girl down 
 so i see you in her arms 
 
 i just say that we'll be together 
 come on, come on 
 say that you wanna be with me too 
 so i'mma stay through it all 
 i never dreamed of this 
 i thought i told you 
 i don’t need you now
