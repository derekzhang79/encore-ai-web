 like starlight, starlight 
 like we dream impossible dreams 
 don't you see 
 oh baby give me a ring 
 
 and it would take brad pitt in your hands 
 and all i thought that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay. 
 
 stay, stay, stay. 
 
 stay. 
 
 this slope is treacherous 
 and i, i, i like it 
 
 and i’ve been holding on 
 way too long 
 but i never felt like i do. 
 
 this is the last 
 i'll be your angel giving up her wings 
 if that's what you do. 
 
 you've got a girl at home, 
 and everybody believed in you? 
 
 it's alright, just wait and see who wins 
 let's talk about what you did to get here 
 let's talk about what you wanted 
 i'm hopelessly devoted to you 
 
 and my daddy said, stay away from " 
 but one second it was perfect 
 
 did some things 
 but i don’t wanna’ have to be something i just remember you said, i'm with me. 
 
 [chorus:]
