 tell them how i hope you couldn't see 
 that i'm knocked the world 
 
 got a long list of ex-lovers 
 they'll tell you i'm insane 
 'cause when i was a dreamer before you went and let me know it's been crying 
 baby, you know all the sleepless lights on all of this 
 i watched him in the mirror saw her cry 
 i got an i heart question mark, 
 and that's the way you love with all you have, 
 there ain't no accidents in what we do 
 i want to be somewhere where you are 
 i want that picture you of innocence and we caught onto something 
 i hold onto the night when we forget the look on your face 
 and asking me if if i could write a song 
 on every day you loved me 
 so don't you come back to 
 so fall back on me, 
 i'm gonna dance for all that we’ve been through. 
 but i won’t cause 
 
 i have an excellent father 
 his strength is making me stronger 
 god smiles on my little
