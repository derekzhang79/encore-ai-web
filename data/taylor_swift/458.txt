 and those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down 
 give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around 
 i can feel to you 
 he did 
 and don't do something for me 
 
 iâ€™m poetry, complicated 
 simply stated 
 hey yeah baby how about you 
 
 waiting for the words 
 so i never knew this time would come 
 when i ask how long you think you're gonna be 
 you say, this crazy world's come undone 
 
 summer's over and leaves begin to fall 
 and another winter's on the way 
 i knew i wasn't gonna take this very well 
 but i figured you out 
 and you can't wait to move out 
 but here now you're thinking 'bout 
 all you're missing how 
 deep you're sinking, 
 round and round and dragging down 
 why don't you try to forget 
 but it sticks in your mind 
 
 so i know 
 all i know 
 i can't resist 
 before you go, tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet 
 sweet escape, sweet escape
