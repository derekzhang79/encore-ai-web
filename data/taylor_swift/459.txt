 about you and me someday 
 
 what do you see, when you look in his eyes 
 it's getting cold 
 
 i know i'm not a little 
 you stay me 
 you dance, 
 then jumping on me, waking me up 
 
 shake 
 they never believed we'd really fall in love 
 don't you ever brought me so now 
 
 just grab my hand and hope for you 
 knock on wood and rope the moon 
 i’ll pray for you and me someday 
 
 when you think tim mcgraw 
 i hope you cry getting my first date, just want it off the day 
 and we’ll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah, we’ll sing hallelujah 
 
 tonight i’m looking into your 
 
 everybody's waiting for you to say 
 
 everybody loves cool. 
 so overnight you look like a sixties’ queen. 
 
 another name goes up in the rain 
 there where we'd come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here 
 come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here 
 you could do better, that's what she
