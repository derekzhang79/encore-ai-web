 since i met you 
 won't you whisper soft and slow? 
 i'm captivated by 
 
 and all that's dead and gone and passed tonight 
 
 just close your eyes 
 the sun is going down 
 you'll be alright 
 come morning light, 
 you and i'll be loving you for quite it mine 
 
 every up the walls to see you 
 you pull me in 
 i'm not feeling anything at all this year 
 i'll bet she's beautiful, that have to know 
 
 you said you'd be here, today and here tomorrow 
 in dark blue tennessee 
 
 sitting in a pretty brown eye 
 i'll make its way to me 
 the playful conversation starts 
 so here's to the things you said you'd be here, 
 you took a swing, i took it hard like jesus made 
 and please remember it 
 
 hey, how have you been 
 what have you seen 
 who were you and where are you? 
 and it might know you better, know you better now 
 i just wanna open your eyes 
 and the sunset had your
