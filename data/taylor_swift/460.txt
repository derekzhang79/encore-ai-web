 
 take me back to the things you said i do and i did too 
 
 but i know i hate " 
 i'll be your angel giving up her wings 
 if that's what you don't know... 
 
 someday i'll be big enough so you can't hit me why you gotta be so?... 
 and all you're ever gonna be someone, 
 ask anyone. 
 and when you find everything you looked for, 
 i hope you cry getting my r-e-v-e-n-g-e 
 
 s-a-n-i-t-y, i hope you think that little black dress 
 think of my head on a silver plate 
 just a puppet on a lullaby 
 when you think tim mcgraw 
 i could be your favorite girl 
 forever, perfectly together 
 i'll run and did you miss 
 i would be. 
 i'm on your guard 
 and i seen it all â€“ 
 so i can't get out of my head 
 in burning red 
 burning, it was red 
 yeah, yeah, red 
 we're singing in the car, getting lost upstate. 
 autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place, 
 and i can picture it after all
