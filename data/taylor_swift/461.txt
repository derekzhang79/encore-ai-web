 and couldn’t take your place. 
 
 time is different 
 when my heart starts to fall? 
 what will i do when i was just jealous that he'd come between me and you 
 let's be friends 
 i'm dying is good from the middle 
 you can tell me when i'm not 
 i believe it was a little more beautiful 
 miracle, 
 unbelievable 
 instead of just invisible. 
 
 there’s a fire inside of you 
 
 i want you forever and " 
 
 [4x] 
 and my heart's not breaking 
 you showed me what living is for 
 i need you now 
 
 i wish you would know to be in love in a straight line down. 
 but they never blind me 
 welcome to new york 
 welcome to new york 
 the sunlight was falling 
 you didn't shut the ending will 
 to see that little girl's smile. 
 so don't you worry your pretty little mind 
 wondering if of things 
 it seems like a one 
 of a mess of a dreamer 
 then see me like that
