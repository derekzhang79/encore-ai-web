 all the boys think she's a spy, she's got bette davis eyes 
 and i knew you were trouble when you walked in 
 the night we snuck into a yacht club party 
 pretending to make a pro blush 
 she got up again 
 i wish that i could touch 
 you go again 
 
 i’ve been holding on 
 way too long 
 but not another minute 
 i might miss you 
 knock on wood and rope the moon 
 i’ll pray for you and me and you 
 and there 
 if i turn around 
 coz i'm not scared 
 of what love gave me and took away 
 and i need you 
 and i don't wanna need you this way, 
 come back... be here. 
 i guess you're in from the name 
 there's never been before 
 we're not sorry 
 no, no, no 
 you're not sorry 
 i'd go back to december, turn around and change my own mind 
 
 i was riding shotgun 
 with your dirty blue jeans 
 and then love this 
 but you're quicksand 
 
 you know sorry
