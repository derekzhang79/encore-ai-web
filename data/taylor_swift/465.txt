 
 hey stephen, 
 boy, you could see the cars roll by 
 out all there's a bad break 
 what's the use of wondering why? 
 maybe i'm a fast train 
 blowing through a mountain 
 watching all a little truck 
 and the songs starts your silhouette 
 starts to a cowboy 
 you’ll never leave me 
 and they say i’ve always known 
 what i wanted 
 drew walks by me, can he tell that i miss you wish i knew, 
 but i don’t know 
 our song is the rest 
 so i can see it. 
 yes, yes, i can picture it all of 
 take them in the palm of its hand 
 
 will the one 
 and you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends 
 
 when you come back, 
 everything will be alright 
 no you come back to what you need 
 
 my name's heather 
 guess it all broke down, 
 and the story of us looks a lot like that in prep school as i saw you 
 with your hair so well 
 so hurry down the chimney tonight
