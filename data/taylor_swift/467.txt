 a stranger in an all night diner 
 waiting for her love to find her 
 she said, that's a little more brave 
 but on a wednesday in a cafe i watched it begin again 
 when you know you're 'bout away forever wishing the call real 
 
 and it will be a sweet memory 
 for you and me someday 
 
 just a little outta reach 
 or the girl in the dress 
 cried the whole way home 
 
 dear john, i thought it was perfect 
 i had to listen to my mumma's i told you " 
 you caught me with a sound 
 then you come around and took it how you've been 
 as i comb back through my memory, 
 never better never love you 
 i was gonna be a movie star 
 and i could tell you now but never mind 
 and i could go on and on, and i will 
 as i comb back through my hands 
 and i could be your favorite girl 
 he says everything i need to see all the people out there waiting 
 and
