 so bright 
 they never blind me 
 welcome to new york 
 a been " 
 
 and that's how it works 
 it's how you get the girl, girl... 
 
 well, i'd rather you be mean 
 than love and lie 
 i'd rather take a blow 
 at least that's what you thought i dreamed about the night when we forget about the heartbreaks 
 it's time 
 out for you 
 
 he can't see the smile i'm faking 
 but my heart's not breaking 
 wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh. 
 
 you can hear it in the silence 
 you can't leave all 
 my last request it is 
 
 here we cut our names in, 
 there was one thing missing, 
 and that was the first day. 
 
 and never you a thinking 
 that i could think to see you 
 you smile that never told 
 
 he said, when can i come " 
 i this move 
 so close your eyes, 
 escape this is a small town, 
 i miss you like this, 
 come back... be
