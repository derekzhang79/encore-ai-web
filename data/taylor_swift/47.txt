 but you come back every time 
 'cause we never gave in 
 and we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah 
 
 so here you are at my window 
 guess nobody told you 
 i don’t wonder where you are 
 i want to jinx my luck 
 i’ve left you in the pouring rain, 
 kiss me on the sidewalk 
 only thirteen blocks across this town 
 to see that you've been 
 'cause you still catch my eye 
 tell me i'm not trying to show maturity 
 
 "x" is the shape i drew through your face 
 in permanent marker 
 oh, yeah 
 just close your eyes 
 the sun is going down 
 you belong with me, 
 you belong with me, 
 you belong with me. 
 
 standing by and waiting at your backdoor. 
 all this time how could you just try to every forever and " 
 cause one second it was perfect to a perfect day 
 every smile you fake is so condescending 
 counting all the scars you made 
 and then you feel so low 
 you can't feel nothing at all
