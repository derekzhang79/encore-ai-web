 
 yeah, oh yeah 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 yeah, we were were happy 
 oh-oh, oh-oh-oh 
 we both stay, stay, stay, stay. 
 
 stay, stay, stay. 
 
 you take my hand and drag me head first 
 fearless 
 and i don't know why would you take me out where things gets where it sounded like all it was a star. 
 
 throwing pennies at the fountain, 
 when you're around 
 yeah yeah 
 all you got, all you walk out 
 not knowing it will be a sweet memory 
 for you and me someday 
 
 so you are too 
 
 he's got his heart on 
 it's a thug story now can i come out of town for coming for you 
 
 i don't wanna come 
 
 well, you've got a girl at home, 
 and everybody knows that. 
 
 i don't wanna turn around 
 coz i'm not scared 
 of what love gave me and took away 
 and i should've been there in the back of your reasons 
 i got no one break your 
 wildest dreams, ah-ha
