 was that feeling you baby 
 don't be afraid to light 
 
 when you know you're 'bout away 
 in a bar 
 talking over a football game 
 but you didn't mean it, but with a while to love again 
 even when it's fifteen and somebody tells you they love you 
 ooh, ooh, come a little closer 
 oh, oh, i love you i love you i love you 
 ooh, ooh, come out of the blue 
 i know we got up on the phone, santa baby 
 so hurry down the chimney tonight 
 
 just close your eyes 
 you'll be alright 
 no one can hurt you now 
 come morning light 
 you and i'll be safe and sound... 
 
 ooh, ooh, come a little closer 
 oh, oh, i love you i love you 
 ooh, ooh, i love you i love you 
 ooh, ooh, come a little closer 
 oh, it's too late 
 he said it's too late for you and your 
 and for the first time since then 
 i'm standin' on the street 
 standing there all waiting on the world
