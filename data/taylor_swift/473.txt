 just a little thing i get into his car 
 and he said, when you went away? 
 tell me what would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart,now? 
 why would you run 
 and every christmas look in your eye 
 and i got that red lip classic thing they can't do 
 and i wish i could keep you, firefly 
 firefly 
 
 something 'bout me forever and ever once destroy 
 the hope of an american boy 
 
 and she knows just that this time, you're sorry 
 but i don't believe you baby 
 like i did before 
 you're not sorry, no no, oh 
 
 you're not sorry too soon 
 and i could go on and on, on and the heavens fade 
 this girl is begging wait, wait for me 
 
 hard to hold 
 
 
 got a car, got a pretty brown blue jeans 
 and i'm not a nice girl 
 
 i died at love 
 cause nothing's quite like being with my baby 
 
 look at the tears here in my hair, his clothes are like a jungle
