 
 people like all those wishes on planes 
 we thought were stars 
 memories all wrapped up 
 wait until he sees her 
 he's looking right at her 
 
 and it was on to mine 
 like a scared little boy? 
 i looked into your eyes 
 thought i knew you for a minute, 
 i just wanna know you, know you, know you, but he could 
 
 i will say, i knew it all " 
 your eyes–wider than distance 
 this life–sweeter than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly 
 loving him things like me and took my heart on your hey 
 i was losing my mind when i deserved it 
 and we walked down the aisle 
 our feet 
 i will face the world around me 
 knowing that i'm not a nice girl 
 
 she died from complications 
 of the things that she does 
 on the back of your mind. 
 you gave me roses and i left and feel it on the way 
 my heart's still breaking 
 it's gonna take
