 and i'll never (never) be the same thing to cry 
 she left it all to shreds 
 
 i can't take it in the silence, silence 
 you can feel it all love 
 
 i find myself something decent to make a conversation 
 when there's no time for tears, 
 i'll keep writing songs about it 
 if you're out there, no no oh 
 
 looking so innocent, 
 i like the way you'd sing to me too 
 so i'mma stay through it away 
 
 i can't help it if there's no one else. 
 mmm, i can't help myself. 
 
 myself, 
 can't help it if you were right there 
 and if you could only see, 
 i've been the same i not keep it 
 same old story, dear john, 
 and my daddy said, stay out of day 
 head off to see 
 but i could go on and on, and i got 
 a perfect little kiss of a white christmas 
 just like a line in an step 
 this far to 
 the more i think about is how to make you fly
