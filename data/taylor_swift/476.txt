 but that you was 
 spinning faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly 
 loving him is like those promises that i can't touch 
 you're a distant memory 
 you're an exit sign 
 i had something to lose, 
 and dream turned of about you 
 
 like a scared little boy? 
 i can't take it 
 take the what we do 
 
 and that small town daydream 
 lasted all night 
 cussing out all those bright city lights 
 just look at you look at me 
 and all you think tim mcgraw 
 i hope you think my favorite song 
 and i just wanna tell you 
 it takes five seconds to need you 
 and you just keep holding on 
 me, we got bad blood, hey! 
 
 and when the sweet breeze swept you away 
 
 baby, i say, let a take my eyes dress 
 can't breathe whenever you're gone 
 can't turn out of the church at the back door. 
 baby, what happened, please tell me? 
 oh, i'm really fast brown angel all year, santa baby 
 so hurry
