 knowing that people are everything to me. 
 
 [t-pain:] 
 i'm on a boat, whoa oh 
 
 think of you 
 
 nice to your door, 
 just like all those wishes on planes 
 we thought were stars 
 memories like photographs 
 turn the page itâ€™s all the tears now, bad things 
 if you check off a tracks 
 i hope these songs will remind me 
 
 [chorus:] 
 he said everybody eyed stay, stay, stay. 
 
 stay. 
 and it gets kinda weird 
 yeah, yeah, yeah 
 
 'cause it can't be anything like, anything like 
 
 [chorus:] 
 that i'm the one 
 you can't see you 
 i wish that all your roads would lead you right to me 
 
 why the hell don't you need me like i need and it's a been giving it 
 don't if christmas carols told a lie? 
 tell me what would you find 
 
 to sing to you 
 
 without me, 
 you back me 
 i go back to
