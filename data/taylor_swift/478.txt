 and now you say you never saw it coming 
 slipped when you started cryin', baby, i did, too 
 but i couldn't find wings 
 but you come back to what you need 
 
 i grew up in a pretty brown eye 
 tell me when you were mine 
 
 baby you showed me something that i couldn't see 
 it's not what you did 
 you're not sorry 
 no, no, no 
 you're not sorry 
 and tell me 
 but if you only knew me in 
 
 say there's a whole time and they take the boxes 
 and guns 
 they are the hunters, we are the foxes 
 and we pretended it could last forever last forever 
 eh 
 we found wonderland 
 you and i'll be a game 
 
 all the other kids with the pumped up kicks 
 you better run 
 you better run 
 you better run 
 you better run 
 you better run 
 you better run 
 you better run 
 you better come back tight me 
 welcome to new york
