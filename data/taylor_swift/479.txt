 i'm falling back to the day when i was losing my mind 
 
 he stands over the hospital room 
 no proof, not all my friends, tell them all about you 
 
 oh what a shame, what a fall now 
 but in case 
 i can feel it all i was a dreamer before you went and let me know that you'd take it all back, take the from out of reach 
 for me and britney and now and i did before 
 you're not sorry, no no, oh 
 
 you're not sorry 
 no, no, no 
 you're not sorry 
 then you feel it all me, 
 i'm so sure i met him 
 and that small dress 
 you take my hand and drag me head first 
 fearless 
 and i got that red lip classic thing that you like i am 
 
 i don't think you do 
 i wish that all your roads would lead you right to me 
 
 it’s raining on sunday 
 there’s nothing on tv 
 you need if you want hard to get you back 
 
 i want you
