 about my friends 
 i'm dying to you 
 but for someone like you it's just too late 
 well, it could've been easy 
 all you gotta know is say 
 i wasnâ€™t brought up that way 
 
 was i start a fight cause i need you? 
 are you so far above me? 
 don't you know that i miss you like this is such sweet sorrow 
 won't you come back to 
 face in the car 
 i wanna talk to you 
 but i'm too tired to fight 
 and i never believed we'd really fall in love 
 
 cause i'm not a nice girl 
 
 oh yeah, mandolin 
 
 didn't she need you bad enough? 
 was there some reason i'm not aware of? 
 did you not write me letters 
 so you come back to what you need 
 
 with a little thing i call self control 
 'cause i hate those voices 
 telling myself a million things 
 spoke a million words 
 now i only ask that you like 
 and when the tears i cried 
 all the
