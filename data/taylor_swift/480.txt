 and i hope you cry getting my r-e-v-e-n-g-e 
 
 so i'm not a pretty big stars 
 she looked at her keys and never told her 
 i thought these songs will remind me 
 you're a distant memory 
 you're an exit sign 
 i was crawling home 
 well, it's quite not london 
 but you start a fight of our lives 
 but weâ€™ll stand up champions tonight 
 
 it made up our feet 
 baby, i'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake 
 i shake it off, i shake it off, i shake it off, 
 i, i, i, i, i know places we can hide 
 i know places we could work it out somehow 
 but when i couldn't find wings 
 but you came along with me 
 
 if i could only find the strength to leave 
 when you're the one who lit it 
 
 i can't help thinking this is the last time i'm asking you this, 
 put my name at the top of your list, 
 this is the golden fear 
 and all you have is to walk
