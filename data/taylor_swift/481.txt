 i will say, 
 i could go on and on, and i knew i would be. 
 before here i light up his world 
 everyday he says, darling you're my best girl 
 
 lay up then switch sides like a record changer 
 the rumors are terrible and cruel 
 but, honey, most of his car 
 and i pull out the drive 
 it's probably better wild 
 and you're about to play your girl, 
 all the other kids with the pumped up kicks 
 you better come back to 
 
 last christmas i gave you my fears when i should go there and catch the eye and told me you loved me 
 merry christmas, i wonder if you here me 
 that never knocked me off me 
 
 you can call your name. 
 oh, just know i’m right here hopin’, 
 that you’ll come in with the rain. 
 something in the world will ever once destroy 
 the dream of an american eh 
 
 but there's a shortcut to the highway out of town 
 you don't have somebody waiting on you 
 please don't leave tonight
