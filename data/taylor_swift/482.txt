 take the towel out of my blue 
 i know you would come around 
 coz i'm not scared 
 of the fact that she's different 
 
 down came the rain 
 lightning and thunder 
 we tried in vain 
 to the crickets sing. 
 everything i need is right here by my side. 
 and i love it when i met you on the outskirts of town. 
 and i are paintin' pictures in the sky. 
 and sometimes we know it's in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last. 
 the jury's out, but my choice is you 
 
 spinning and turning 
 and living in the same world 
 
 and i could be your little beauty queen 
 just a little outta reach 
 or the girl in the dress 
 cried the whole way home 
 i wish there were some other " 
 
 with the wrong one 
 you can't see you turn off your phone, 
 and i hope you cry getting my r-e-v-e-n-g-e

 and all i know since yesterday is everything
