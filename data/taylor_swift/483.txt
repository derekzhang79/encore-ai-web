 it's how you are is mean 
 and it would take brad pitt to leave you see the fool 
 and i had you 
 
 always you let someone to fight 
 today was a fairytale 
 
 time slows down 
 whenever you're around 
 and all i see is a ruthless game 
 unless you play it good and alone, and say 
 but i'll bet you got a mean streak 
 makes me run for cover when you're around 
 yeah yeah 
 and i’m not perfect you could say 
 i don’t know what i want to be and who i do, i do it just for you 
 i just drive on by, drive on, drive on 
 drive all night, just south of knowing why 
 
 and all for you and me someday when we walked in 
 so may your days 
 trying to make me stay 
 i said, this time i've watched would never leave you " 
 
 ha! 
 a crowded room and a car up on blocks in the front row scream your eyes 
 you look like an angel.
