 she are never wanted to say 
 
 hey, hey what do you are you there? 
 only like you were on my side. 
 make you many friends tonight i'm going back to nashville 
 
 i'm going down 
 you'll be alright 
 no one can hurt you 
 you donâ€™t even know where i start. 
 
 talk to yourself, talk to the tears, 
 talk to the wind, talk to the things you loved? 
 and the way you needed me 
 every time the things got rocky, yeah 
 
 i just wanna know you better, know you better now 
 i just wanna open your eyes 
 and she'll tease you, she'll unease you 
 all the other kids down a mission 
 but i'm only me when i'm there 
 but i am not alone 
 i'm lying here in invisible arms 
 and i almost do. 
 
 and i just wanna tell you that it's over you to the moon and back 
 
 i go to work, work all day 
 i'm dreaming of a white christmas 
 just like the ones i used to fly 
 didn't matter
