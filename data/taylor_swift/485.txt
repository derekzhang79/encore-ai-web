 from pretty 
 and i stood there loving you and wished them all away 
 i always knew this time 
 not this time 
 cause there were christmases when you were mine 
 
 you had a look on the inside 
 oh what you get is what you see 
 baby you hold the key 
 to the diary of me 
 
 cause i should've seen from this part of the fight i see you, today 
 
 what if ribbons and bows didn't mean a thing? 
 would the song still survive without five golden rings? 
 would you tell me you loved me 
 so why are you crying? 
 you're better off, you're better off without him 
 find yourself another 
 
 [t-pain:] 
 i'm on a mission 
 but i'm so quiet in the world tonight 
 catching stars and fireflies 
 the summer sings a lullaby 
 with just me and you walk right pouring down with a great little story 
 thatâ€™s a shortcut to the highway out of town 
 you can see through everything but my heart 
 first 
 looking for the love
