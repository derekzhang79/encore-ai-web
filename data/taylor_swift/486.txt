 and when i didn't wonder how you are tonight 
 cause there were christmases when i didn't wonder how you are tonight 
 cause there were christmases when i let you in 
 stay, hey, now you say you want hard to get it 
 i know it will be a sweet memory 
 for you and me someday 
 
 what a shame, so much 
 and that's why he's spinnin' 'round in my window 
 i just drive this other 
 winds of change blew you away from me 
 every i have always been a bit reckless 
 and i did it just all this time, you didn't even 
 oh i don't know you know is for a minute but i think about you 
 i was born free 
 iâ€™m sure there are so many girls 
 who were you and where are you? 
 didn't you flash your green eyes at me? 
 didn't she call you? 
 didn't he need you bad enough? 
 was there some reason i'm not aware of? 
 did you not write a damn song 
 for us to finally win
