 i know places 
 in the dead of night, your eyes so green 
 i know places we can hide 
 i know places 
 
 they are the hunters, we are the foxes 
 and all my friends are saying 
 i thought i had you figured out 
 can't breathe whenever you're gone 
 can't turn back now, it's all good. 
 i wish you would 
 i wish you would 
 
 tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet 
 come running headlong into my eyes 
 and you tell me 
 cause it's worked each time before 
 
 but i never planned on you changing your mind 
 
 was as he's walking home 
 saying, does he " 
 will you coming up 
 itâ€™s must be sound that you hear is "no" 
 you say you're 'bout to cry. 
 i watch superman fly away 
 come back i'll be with you someday 
 i'll be sick inside if baby you'd be my cure 
 
 i told you never mind 
 and i was there when you said forever
