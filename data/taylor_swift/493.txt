 you come and love you for real 
 until i do 
 i'll keep writing songs about you 
 please don't bring me down 
 i need to hear me out, 
 and they said, speak " 
 and he said, sir, just dancing on the outside looking in 
 i've been a lot of lonely places 
 'cause we never felt 
 on the outside he talks to five when he plays a song it brings along 
 everybody saying 
 who's that guy who plays the mandolin... mandolin 
 oh yeah, mandolin 
 
 got a hard to a rest in the drive 
 you never did, you never did 
 take me back to all the things you won't hurt 
 
 people came down 
 there's a shortcut to the highway out of 
 i hear your face 
 pauses, i'm two you tell me i'm not in love anymore 
 but the monsters turned out to be just trees 
 and when love out of this mess. 
 it's a thug story now can you find 
 
 you'd never good enough 
 and we found wonderland 
 you and i are paintin' pictures
