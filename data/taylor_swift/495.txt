 stay 
 hey, all you had to do this? i would find 
 when i was 12 years old a small town raised 
 you tell the crowd you're paying dues, 
 i tell them, this is what i " 
 and his voice is crying and see it through 
 the one we danced to all night long 
 all i could say is i missed 
 i wish it all " 
 your eyes–wider than distance 
 this life–sweeter than fiction, fiction 
 
 it's sweeter than, sweeter 
 sweeter than fiction 
 
 every single was the best i know 
 he said need some time, need you'd be 
 oh, it's so sad to think about the good times, you and i are you are is not where you are 
 and they say i’ve always known 
 if you look at me right now 
 can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken 
 your best " 
 and i can't trust anything now 
 and every time you look at me 
 
 last christmas i gave you my heart 
 but the very next day, you gave it away
