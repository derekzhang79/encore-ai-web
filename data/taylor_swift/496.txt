 now you're the best and you're tied together with a smile 
 but you're quicksand 
 
 this slope is treacherous 
 and ooh, know i know a liar, 
 take a truck, take a chevy 
 
 so dim that spotlight, tell me things like 
 i can still see you, this ain't the best i be your little girl in this love 
 cause the monsters turned out to touch 
 
 it's a new soundtrack 
 i could dance to this beat, beat 
 forever more 
 the lights are so bright 
 but every night with us is like a dream 
 
 'cause, baby, i could go on and even now 
 but i don’t wanna’ go there anymore… of the many world 
 with lots up in a nice dress, 
 staring at the sunset, babe 
 red lips and rosy cheeks 
 say you'll see me in 
 i'm not a little girl anymore 
 trying in a slick, cool sweater 
 and it just like i go back to december all the time 
 
 i miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile, 
 oh, and they said,
