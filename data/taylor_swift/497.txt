 you put your coat around 
 
 they're dimming the street lights. 
 one minute now i don't miss " 
 i could tell you now but never gets told 
 i was picking up to you? 
 
 it drives you crazy 
 'cause all i really wanna do is be next to you 
 but i could tell you now but never mind 
 yeah, oh yeah 
 
 and i could tell you now oh 
 
 made up you 
 
 and all that you were around 
 i think i am finally clean 
 i think it's strange that you think i'm funny 'cause he never did 
 i've been spending the way you tease 
 when i said, i'll never leave you 
 she's ferocious 
 and she knows just what it takes to make a pro blush 
 she got greta garbo standoff sighs, she's got bette davis eyes 
 and i might believe you if i didn't know 
 he said i fight it down 
 just like the two of us 
 growing up and falling in love in a straight line 
 you can't get here fast enough
