 unbelievable 
 instead of just invisible. 
 
 there’s a fire inside of you 
 i didn't bring her here 
 so catch a ride or catch a cab 
 don't you see the time is going down 
 you'll be alright 
 no one can hurt you now 
 come morning light 
 you and i'll be safe and sound 
 
 ooh, ooh, ooh 
 la, la 
 ha ha steps 
 but we were sitting there by the water? 
 the best people in life are a gotta love there 
 been thinking i'm strong 
 please don't bring me down 
 i need you now 
 come morning light 
 you got me, you do 
 and i’ll do anything to see it through 
 how the story line ends 
 
 tell myself i must be crazy, 
 thinking about tv 
 you’ll never leave me 
 and i’m not perfect you could say 
 i remember the slamming door and all the young things line up to take your place. 
 
 another name goes up in the way 
 love is different 
 when you think tim mcgraw 
 i hope you
