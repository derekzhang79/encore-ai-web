 when we started home it started to live with the pain 
 guess i loved you will " 
 and that's what i intend to do 
 i'm hopelessly devoted to you 
 hopelessly devoted to you 
 
 but love's got me cornered in the back of the room 
 i'm spinning around, i'm spinning around 
 and all i know, you can show me what you do 
 what did you here it 
 
 i didn't even know you 
 and time is taking its sweet time erasing you 
 and i know i know i loved you but it's not that look at me 
 and every time you're here 
 baby i'll show you that i don't know 
 but here i am lost in your eyes 
 i might be leaving 
 
 i don't have a plan, i don't believe you baby 
 like a better just 
 
 i'm sick and tired of your reasons 
 she got up again
