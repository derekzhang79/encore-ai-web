 
 i just can't tell you why 
 but somehow i know i 
 looking in the mirror 
 heart all wrapped around 
 
 will you take it 
 out of focus, taking those other girls 
 chasing fortune and fame. 
 and the camera flashes, make it smile 
 
 just so frustrating intoxicating 
 complicated, got away 
 and i don't wanna miss you like this, 
 come back... be here, come on my own 
 i walk to you 
 you pull my chair out and help it all – 
 baby, you were watching me 
 you be you and i’ll be me 
 
 talking 'bout your daddy's farm 
 and so you were bad news 
 but baby i was a dreamer before you went and let me down, 
 as we left 
 i'm just another thing for me 
 
 every single time i come on this show 
 it's really weird 
 always been a dreamer 
 you're an exit sign 
 i can still feel your arms 
 
 so i guess i wished on a plane 
 my mama says that it'll be alright 
 no them
