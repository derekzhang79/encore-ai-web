 
 you looking me in the bathroom with a hidden camera your green 
 he tried to catch me now 
 it's not sorry 
 no, no, no 
 you're not sorry 
 no, no one else. 
 mmm, i can't help myself. 
 
 myself, 
 can't help myself, 
 i can't wait for the day i stop pretending 
 that you’ll come in with the rain. 
 i hear the lines long 
 
 and don't hate me tonight 
 like you always again 
 
 i’ll leave my window open, 
 ‘cus i’m too tired at night to call your name. 
 
 he said, look at you to break 
 
 all the time 
 
 i know who you are 
 what you dream impossible things? 
 i could give you fifty reasons 
 why i should be leaving 
 i should go out of all the bricks they threw at me 
 and every day is like a burning flame 
 down came the rain 
 lightning and thunder 
 we tried in vain 
 to the diary of me 
 
 the way you cuss 
 i wrote your name
