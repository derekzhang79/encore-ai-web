 
 me 
 i bet these memories 
 follow you around 
 the only one who's got enough of me to break 
 
 this love, this love, this love, this love, this love... [4x] 
 
 one without a permanent scar 
 and did you miss me while you want to be forever but it's too bad you didn't see that to 
 for it away? 
 tell me what i drive away, 
 driving a little closer 
 oh, oh, oh, oh 
 oh, and it's like i come home this far 
 but i do 
 
 and they tell you that you’re lucky. 
 but you’re out of the church at the back door that i hope you hear 
 but i fell hard you took a step back 
 without you just try to i'd never know 
 that you would walk away. 
 it don't make sense to me, but: 
 
 they like me are gone 
 and i remember thinkin' 
 
 [chorus 2x:] 
 are we out of the woods? 
 
 in my mind 
 both me and my baby 
 the closer that we get
