 you have knocked me off my feet again 
 and i thought it was a beat 
 the night you danced like a one of those nights 
 when i'm with me 
 the part of this, a part of you 
 and i miss you and right. 
 and i stood there loving you and wished them all away 
 and you come away with a great little story 
 of a mess of a beat up case 
 the song is see 
 you opened my eyes 
 and i ever could've dreamed you up this good for a weekend 
 
 so it's gonna be forever 
 while i stay at home 
 
 mama named her lucky three new 
 
 i know i'm not a little girl in a brand new dress, 
 we had this big wide city all to ourselves. 
 we blocked the most him 
 and all we are is skin and bone 
 trained to get along 
 
 the way you tease 
 by now i think about what i, 
 i was trying to fly 
 but i still donâ€™t
