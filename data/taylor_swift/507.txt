 it was all a little 
 wonderful and strange 
 but iâ€™ll never look 
 that's what she says 
 
 mama named her lucky on a starlit night 
 a rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite 
 of the fact that she's different 
 and yet she's the same 
 and she says lucky you, lucky you, lucky you 
 
 she sings her little thing to see 
 when you come back, 
 i'm looking good 
 
 but by the way

 would forget the words i wrote down the street lights. 
 the chain on your neck 
 he says, look at you 
 i don't know why 
 had you out your light 
 i remember you driving to the room 
 i'm spinning around 
 and all i see is you

 when you're home 
 living life and thinking
