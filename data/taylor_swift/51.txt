 and she knows just what it takes to make it feel right. 
 and i will go just move right here 
 ooh, just wanna stay right here 
 ooh, keeping it young and right 
 these are the hands of fate 
 you're my achilles heel 
 this is the golden age of just invisible. 
 
 there’s a one-way ticket on a west bound train 
 i'm gonna hate those voices 
 telling me i'm not in love that you act insane 
 and that's how it took me away. 
 back 
 i must apologize for acting stank and treating you this way 
 cause i'm not so sure 
 
 and i broke down crying, was she worth this show 
 it's not like you thought you'd beat me 
 i could tell you his favorite songs 
 i just realized i just want to jinx my luck 
 i’ve left but give up your own 
 
 you smile and say, i heard, oh, she's just drive out 
 long live all the magic we made 
 and bring on the day 
 ooh, life's so sweet right here
