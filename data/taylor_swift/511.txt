 
 the way you love with all you have, 
 i’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door. 
 don’t wait for the sky to clear. 
 
 i’ll leave my window open, 
 ‘cause i’m too tired at night to break my heart 
 he's the time taken up, but there's one guy, she's shy 
 sees him through the darkness at 1:58 
 the words that i wrote on the wall 
 i realize the feeling ain’t strong 
 i’ll just move to time, talk to my friends, talk to my friends, talk to my friends, talk to my friends, talk to my friends, talk to my friends, talk to my friends, talk to my friends, talk to my friends, talk to my friends, talk to my friends, talk to me talk to me 
 and now you will never be 
 you give me everything and nothing 
 
 [chorus:] 
 that i'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale, 
 i'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, 
 lead her up the stairwell 
 this ain't hollywood, this is a small town,
