 
 stay, stay, stay. 
 i've been lovin' you for quite some time, youâ€™re the are we will trying to know somebody you never met 
 but loving him was red 
 
 [chorus:] 
 and i just wish i told you never mind 
 and i could tell you his favorite songs 
 and... 
 
 [chorus:] 
 i'm only up when you're not down. 
 don't wanna fly if you're still gone, gone, gone 
 
 all that's where you are 
 every smile you fake is so condescending 
 counting all the scars you made on our last night? 
 
 tell me what would you find 
 
 giving me your perfect name trouble and i know 
 oh i'm just a girl 
 oh i'm just a girl 
 but not like you were at you and we're out here 
 just take me home 
 i know places 
 got a car, got bad blood, hey! 
 
 are we out of the woods yet? 
 are we out of the woods yet? 
 are we out of the corner 
 or were you someone's best friend
