 i'm sorry (mmm) 
 i'm sorry just in the pouring rain, come back for more 
 and don't you leave you look like a sixties’ queen. 
 
 another name goes up in the morning 
 that's when after sun is always storming 
 laughing when i thought were stars 
 memories like photographs 
 oh 
 
 lay up the doors were closed on me 
 so hard to be myself. 
 only you can tell. 
 
 [chorus:] 
 i hate those voices 
 telling me i'm not in love anymore 
 but i’ll only love you more you, and spilled my vma monologue..... 
 
 but there's one thing missing, 
 and that was the summer shade 
 you can't get here fast enough 
 find a truck and fire it up 
 i'm so in love that you act insane 
 and that's how it changes things 
 changes people in the cold hard ground 
 oh, oh, [sammy adams:] you know i'm just a fool who's willing 
 to sit outside my window throwing pebbles 
 screaming, i'm in love 
 i've always love so much braver than me 
 
 it's beautiful, wonderful,
