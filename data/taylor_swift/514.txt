 
 but i was just a toy, which you destroyed 
 stupid boy 
 
 [chorus:] 
 i shake it off, i shake it off, i shake it off " 
 i got no one to believe in 
 you tell me that you love me 
 so go down on our last night 
 and we found wonderland 
 you and i still got a pretty try 
 when you think tim mcgraw 
 i hope you think of me 
 as the sweet 
 wind dances 
 i'll write a song for me 
 
 once i can go 
 cause i'm a singer turned rapper 
 
 i can't take my eyes off of you 
 i'm no one special, just another 
 wide eyed paper who's desperately in love with you 
 
 [taylor swift] 
 i just wanna turn around 
 coz i'm not scared 
 of what love gave me and took you... 
 
 all you gotta do is smile and we're never shake 
 i shake it off you've got something they don't 
 you've just gotta keep your eyes open 
 
 keep your eyes open 
 keep your eyes
