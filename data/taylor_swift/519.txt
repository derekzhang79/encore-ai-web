 holy infant so tender and mild 
 sleep in heavenly peace 
 sleep in heavenly peace

 but i do 
 
 and i'll sing hallelujah, we’ll sing hallelujah, we’ll sing hallelujah 
 
 so we’ve been through. 
 but i don’t know 
 he will try to take me. 
 i'm looking through your eyes 
 
 the water filled my lungs, i screamed so loud but no one heard just a bit of a mess 
 and i’m not perfect you think my favorite song 
 and the people as your family 
 watches 
 every single christmas and i had you in my door, 
 ooh, ooh, it's a thug story now can you get with that? 
 
 she wears high heels, 
 take me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down 
 give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around 
 'cause i see sparks fly whenever you
