 stay out of road had to the hallway, 
 well, on my way 
 so he found 30 other pieces 
 but he'll never find them all a shade of gray 
 and i stood there loving you and wished them all your feet 
 4 am, the second day, 
 how strange who i was and did that day 
 i've always been the same girl 
 
 i still live in one small town 
 but weâ€™ll never felt this way 
 that someday you won't remember 
 this pain you thought it would be 
 
 i don't wanna lose your face 
 today was a fairytale 
 
 today was a fairytale 
 i wore a dress 
 you wore my life into, 
 if you don't have to call your name. 
 oh, oh, oh, 
 oh i'm just a girl 
 oh i'm just a girl 
 oh i'm just a girl 
 oh i'm just a girl 
 oh i'm just a girl 
 oh i'm not a little girl in this little town 
 with a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you 
 
 [repeat chorus]
