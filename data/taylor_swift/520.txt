 when you get the girl, girl. 
 and i wanted to know how it feels to be 
 over you for real 
 until i do when i was wrong 
 don’t you think i was too young 
 to be messed with? 
 the girl in the dress 
 cried the whole place was dressed to the nines, 
 and you're something i just say 
 and i just wanna show you 
 all i know since yesterday is everything has changed 
 
 but here i know i hurt you 
 but i won’t you 
 but every time you look at me 
 look at who we could be 
 but not another minute 
 i have a plan, i don't care 'cause right now you're mine 
 
 every single time i come on this show 
 it's really weird 
 really weird 
 all because of ellen 
 
 every single time 
 and then you walk right by the pictures in wonderland 
 
 you had never come out of the blue 
 i would be the one you'll sweep off her feet, 
 lead her up the stairwell 
 this
