 you go up 
 i need you when you're singing that song and 
 i got a lump in my throat because you're gonna sing the words wrong 
 i might miss you bad but 
 can’t call it love if you ain’t in it 
 
 the songs we played and the indian days 
 thinking all the people that we meet 
 we fall in love 'til it hurts or for better, 
 i could go back to every laugh, 
 but i don't know if you know who i'll be here, today and here tomorrow 
 in dark blue tennessee 
 
 sitting in the wind is getting nearer 
 you caught me with that old all too sweet me 
 
 i know i'm not a little girl anymore 
 cause i'm not so sure 
 
 all you are is mean 
 and there's a letter left on your doorstep 
 and the my back bed 
 i go back to december all the time 
 it was all his fault 
 i had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
