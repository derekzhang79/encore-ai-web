 
 living off and watching me up 
 the front porch steps 
 after everything i must been been you at a one of those nights 
 when you're thinkin' about a kiss 'til the morning light 
 you got me, you do 
 i bet you're sitting in your nice dress, 
 staring at the sunset, babe 
 red lips and rosy cheeks 
 say you'll see me again 
 even if it's just in case 
 there was a scene and that your friends 
 which apparently is a crime 
 
 do you honestly expect me so close 
 but turn around 
 coz i'm not scared 
 of what love gave me and took away 
 and i don't wanna feel you by my side 
 standing by and waiting at your backdoor. 
 all the love they pushed aside 
 but people like me like you 
 i wish i knew, 
 but i did before 
 you're not sorry, no no, oh 
 
 you're not sorry 
 no, no, no 
 you're not sorry 
 i'd rather hear the lines long 
 keep on melting up to see 
 the moment
