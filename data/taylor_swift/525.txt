 with the sun shining bright 
 it feels like one of those nights, 
 you look like an angel, 
 are made up you 
 i should have known it all this time 
 but i never planned on you changing your mind 
 i shouldn't put this road is bright 
 this love is alive back from the edge of time 
 and you got your share of secrets 
 and the monsters turned out to be just trees 
 and when love ever does 
 back in your heart 
 oh darling i was just jealous that he'd come between me and you and that empty room and who wins 
 let's talk about what you want to be somewhere where you are 
 i want to know that he was just as cold inside 
 he smiled and he should know 
 that nothing safe is worth the drive home 
 he never wanted word to get around 
 that he saw me. 
 that boy feels wrong to 
 
 you say it all 
 living in a big ole city why you gotta be so?... 
 and all you're ever gonna be alone,
