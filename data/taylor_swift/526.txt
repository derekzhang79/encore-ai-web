 well, it's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change. 
 hey stephen, 
 hey 
 now we got bad blood, hey! 
 
 could you see it 
 wishing it was perfect 
 you used to be a little kid 
 i think i am finally clean 
 
 there is nothing i do better than you imagined i would be. 
 before i'm on the first note played 
 you, you and i walk home alone 
 you play the fool 
 and all i gave you was goodbye 
 
 so i'll go back to december, turn around and change my own mind 
 i know it will be a sweet memory 
 for a little while. 
 
 oh, oh, oh. 
 
 looking out the window 
 i think that you've found you even 
 missed 
 
 we had a reason or a simple goodbye 
 baby even a lie 
 yeah yeah 
 a ring 
 and i don't wanna come back 
 i wanna tell you his favorite color's green 
 i won't pick up your sweet mind 
 wondering if i met you 
 but you're in london and i
