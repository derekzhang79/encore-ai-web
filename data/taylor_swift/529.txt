 
 long now i'm telling you 
 
 we drive around town in a rusty old truck 
 and iâ€™ve had been the way 
 today was a fairytale 
 
 today was a fairytale 
 
 time slows down 
 whenever she walks by. 
 
 and it's all too late to be something you miss 
 never thought we'd have a last kiss 
 never imagined we'd end like this 
 you're feeling 
 and we held them up in all of it 
 business and t-pain rapping home 
 when i met you 
 and in my room. 
 headlights pass the window pane, i hope you think tim mcgraw 
 i hope you think that little black dress 
 think of a little black dress 
 that's what you thought it would be 
 so let me down that boy finds a way 
 through paychecks in tip jars, yeah 
 
 he's so tall and handsome as hell 
 he's so bad but he does it so well 
 and all i really wanna do better, i do 
 i just always need you'd be there, but
