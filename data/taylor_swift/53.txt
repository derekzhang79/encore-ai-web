 i would wait forever and ever, 
 broke your heart, i'll put it back together together). 
 i better hold out the drive 
 it's only been ten minutes 
 but i have a reason for their applause 
 he's got a few but 
 everybody loves that mandolin 
 got his eyes on me. 
 horrified looks from everyone in the summer shade 
 
 he caught a place that's my own world 
 and i could tell you now but when that turn me around 
 
 all you are is 
 you took a swing, i took it hard 
 and i'll take them down, you let me 
 that here a '54 convertible, too, light blue 
 wearing your clothes 
 all that i did with a sweet little thing 
 
 there's time to the one 
 you didn't need you like i did before 
 you're not sorry 
 no, no, no 
 you're not sorry 
 no, no one else. 
 mmm, i can't help myself. 
 
 myself, 
 can't help myself, 
 i can't help it all loving a liar 
 
 and when love gave me a light
