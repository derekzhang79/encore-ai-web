 never imagined we'd end like this 
 you're not sorry 
 no, no, no 
 you're not sorry 
 didn't you calm here 
 i ainâ€™t lost in your eyes 
 you make me crazier, crazier 
 feels like i'm falling and i am lost in your eyes 
 you make me crazier, crazier 
 feels like i'm falling and i didn't mean it, i was just jealous that he'd come between me and you 
 
 and it was a summer everything i thought was on my side 
 bye, bye, baby 
 now i know 
 but i'll never known 
 missing him was fine 
 it must have been the way you kissed me 
 fell in love that i could touch 
 i need you when you're singing that song and 
 i got a lump in my throat because you're looking for their long heart 
 he's a little bit more 
 said did 
 need you believe in me 
 
 every single time i come on this show 
 it's not goodnight 
 cause i'll be seeing you in my dreamin' 
 
 boy, you got me a nice new apartment
