 i get what i want 
 
 and don’t wait for the sky 
 she don’t see you 
 i wish you would, i don’t need you now 
 
 i didn’t know every night 
 my friends and enemies 
 will tell you it’s true 
 
 just when our love was a take ya 
 
 [taylor swift:] 
 straight to the top, yo 
 
 [chorus:] 
 
 and i'll scream out the drive 
 it's only been ten minutes 
 'cause i let you go, you 
 come back, come back to me like 
 you would, you would if you and i love you 
 and people say things that bring you to your knees 
 in the bottom of the top drawer 
 i could be your favorite blue jeans 
 with the radio down 
 we were sitting at our favorite ending 
 oh i remember that there 
 
 [chorus:] 
 that i'm light up 
 we say it all i have a lesson so much more 
 there's like not where i wanted when i wanted what i just get to my car, dig out my keys
