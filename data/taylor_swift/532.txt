 and i am lost in your eyes 
 me and britney 
 
 oh, oh 
 i knew you were trouble when you walked in 
 trouble, trouble, trouble 
 
 [sammy adams:] 
 double platinum wherever she go 
 south of just invisible. 
 
 thereâ€™s a fire inside of you 
 
 for all the rage 
 get a look on the street 
 standing next to me 
 yeah, i show you, can you handle that? 
 
 [t-pain & taylor:] 
 diamonds in my mouth 
 oh, all my friends are saying 
 girl, what are you thinking? 
 you're better off, you're better off 
 without me, without me, without me, without me. 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 just a little outta reach 
 or the girl 
 but i wanted you to chase after our last breath 
 trying to get along 
 forever the way you take me with your eyes 
 they're not talking a week or two 
 
 oh, daddy can i go with you? 
 oh, daddy can i go with you? 
 oh, daddy can i go with you? 
 oh, daddy can i go with you?
