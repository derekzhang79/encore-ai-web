 i fight out your name 
 you gotta come on, come on 
 say that we'll be together 
 come on, come on 
 say that you wanna be with me too 
 so i'mma stay through it and took a reason for the teardrops on my guitar 
 the only reason is you're seeing how much better off without him 
 find yourself another 
 girl, that boy is trouble 
 you're better off, you're better off 
 they can talk forever, they just don't know better 
 
 it's so wrong that all i tried so all the boys i haven't kissed 
 next year 
 i could tell you now but 
 
 oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day 
 
 i never miss you 
 he didn't get this song that night 
 
 oh yeah, all right 
 take it easy like too 
 but every time you look at me 
 look at who we could be 
 i think i am finally clean 
 
 there is a video 
 i found you all of you 
 but those kisses up
