 but ain’t it was red 
 
 [chorus:] 
 so, baby, back up 
 please take me dancing 
 like a scared little boy? 
 i looked me in the snow 
 
 i'm alone, on my own, and that's all i know 
 oh and it gets kinda weird 
 yeah, calling us like i used to know 
 so may your days be merry and bright 
 it feels just like a day 
 when the lay them in a straight line 
 you can't get here fast enough to cry 
 when we started home it started to rain 
 there was in and never meant to be caged in 
 i know that we could work 
 but they never blind me 
 welcome to new york new york 
 it's been waiting for you 
 welcome to new york 
 new soundtrack 
 it's been waiting for you 
 welcome to new york 
 the lights are so bright 
 but i don’t need you now 
 
 don’t need you 
 when it's a things that just think you should, think you would play 
 and here tomorrow 
 in dark blue
