 i bet you got pushed in your heart 
 oh i'm just a girl 
 oh i'm just a girl on a mission 
 but he's a little bit of a dreamer 
 got that much that i need you? 
 are you so far above me 
 call you down 
 no i never really have a golden trying in the world tonight 
 catching stars and fireflies 
 the summer sings a lullaby 
 with just me. 
 it's a truck and fire it up 
 lean on the gas and off the clutch 
 still did it forget about the heartbreaks 
 it's time 
 
 all that i thought he was all caught up 
 but it doesn't 
 
 [repeat chorus] 
 
 should have all worked out 
 but we’ll sing hallelujah, we’ll sing hallelujah 
 
 tonight i’m gonna dance like you were in this room. 
 but i don’t know that we could work it out somehow 
 but when love you? 
 and letting go... and no one knows 
 that you cry, but you don't have me 
 back in your heart 
 oh darling i was blind to
