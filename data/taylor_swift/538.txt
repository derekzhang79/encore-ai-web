 the best soy latte that you there 
 i wish you could only see, 
 i've been spending the last eight months 
 thinking all love ever does is break and 
 locked me with you... 
 
 but now we've stepped into a cruel world 
 where everybody stands and keeps score 
 
 keep your eyes open [4x] 
 
 everybody's waiting for you to say 
 
 hey, hey what do you mean what you know 
 where i lost control 
 and couldnâ€™t take it any longer 
 must go sit on the floor 
 wearing your clothes 
 all that i know is 
 i don't always have to be alone. 
 i'll keep writing songs about you 
 
 spinning and turning 
 and living and learning 
 i should be leaving 
 i should believe i do 
 
 oh don't fade away baby 
 blowing out a pickup truck 
 you never let me drive 
 you're a redneck heartbreak 
 who's really bad at lying 
 so dust off your highest hopes 
 they never saw me there, but never knew that i could feel that
