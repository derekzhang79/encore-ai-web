 i try to grab just like a full-on rainstorm 
 and waiting then i know you're not scared of anything at all 
 and you made me believe again 
 as i breathe the smoke and cheap perfume 
 
 and i got that red lip classic thing that you like everything was slipping through the air 
 
 peace, love 
 one thing leads into another 
 can't been the perfect day 
 just one day

 in wonderland 
 eh [5x] 
 in wonderland 
 eh [5x] 
 in wonderland 
 eh [5x] 
 in wonderland 
 eh [5x] 
 in wonderland 
 
 i reached for you for me and my baby 
 the sick and tired of your reasons 
 i just wanna make you mine 
 
 and they tell you that you’re lucky. 
 but you’re so confused, 
 'cause it's late and your mama don't know 
 our song is the way you kiss, the way you want her 
 but it said enough 
 
 so perfectly together 
 now it's no no in and 
 cause i guess i never thought
