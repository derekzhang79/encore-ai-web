 when we never been 
 
 i won't tell 
 is a hand-me-downs star when you made life your own 
 every sky was your own kind of blue 
 and then you feel so low 
 you can't feel standing on the front porch steps 
 you say mine 
 i go back to december all the time 
 
 i know this shouldn't be a lonely time 
 but i do 
 
 and i wish i could know that you see what you're doing to me 
 tell me 
 
 he said, i do when i could believe you baby 
 like i love you for real 
 until i do 
 
 i'll just wait for the day 
 i know there's a star, 
 i guess you'd see that today holds something special 
 something holy, not superficial 
 so here's to everything that we stood there 
 no i seen i go back to december, turn around and change my own mind 
 tell me 
 i hang on every word you see all these things you told her 
 i guess heard you found somebody
