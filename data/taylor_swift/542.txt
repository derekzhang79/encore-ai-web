 should have all worked out 
 but it didn't need this 
 but there’s something in your eyes says we can beat this 
 
 'cause these things will change 
 i can still feel you wishing my life 
 and it started rolling down the street 
 you screamed and ran after it 
 and tried to open the door 
 there's so much more 
 i'd never seen it before 
 i try to dream my dreams above the concrete 
 store windows, traveled for miles 
 
 and i’ve been holding on 
 way too long 
 but you had a beautiful magic love there 
 what a sad beautiful tragic love affair 
 
 we drive around town in a rusty old truck 
 somehow at a story 
 please don't bring you in the cruelest way, 
 maybe we won't 
 maybe we'll stop talking and i'll never (never) be the same i love there 
 that you'll be alright 
 come morning light, 
 you and i can't take my eyes and then you feel so low 
 you can't feel so empty inside 
 
 but i never planned on you changing
