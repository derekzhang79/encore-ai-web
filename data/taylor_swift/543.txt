 
 put a long goodbye, 
 as i paced back and forth all this time 
 'cause i was losing my mind 
 
 the phone rings on a rainy night 
 she looked at her keys and standing out the back 
 you’re the only one who gets me 
 my mind is like an island 
 drifting through the ocean 
 i can’t stop thinking about you 
 i was begging you, please don't " 
 and all you do is let me down 
 
 do you remember the day 
 said it looks so good 
 to be messed with? 
 the girl in the dress 
 cried the whole way home, way home 
 you could see it with the lights out, lights out 
 you found me out like a penny in the rain 
 oh, it's the perfect passion and i can't touch 
 you go i hope you think that little black dress 
 think of my head on a silver plate 
 just a small town boy and girl 
 hey what are you thinking? 
 you're better off, you're better off 
 they said, i'll never let you "
