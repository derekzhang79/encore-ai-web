 i just wanna show you that sweet 
 so fall back on me 
 tell me 
 and every day is like a new notch in your belt is all i'll ever leave i'll be crawling back for more 
 and don't you know 
 you're not in love you 
 cause it wasn't just like a movie 
 you're the only thing i am finally clean 
 i think i know you'd fool me again 
 
 it's a scene and we're out here in plain sight 
 i can hear them whisper as all we are 
 so catch a ride or catch a cab 
 where you are is not where you've been. 
 you're still an innocent. 
 
 did you dream impossible 
 where is me 
 and how you held me in 
 and your mother's eyes, i didn't mean for you to get hurt 
 whatsoever 
 we can take it easy baby 
 make it last all night 
 oh yeah, all right 
 she still hasn't called in my dreams above the concrete 
 store windows, traveled for miles
