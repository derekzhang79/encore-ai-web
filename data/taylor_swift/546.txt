 so i can talk forever, if you just had there, you took the road and puts her picture down saying, 
 
 missing you like this is such in a green 
 sure you've found 
 you got your laugh, your ghost, your jacket 
 guess i drive home again 
 and i never been a lot of lonely places 
 i've never been so wrapped up, honey 
 i like the way you wanted me 
 and i swear i'm caught up in you 
 just like i'm becoming part of a smile 
 but i took you when you were leaving 
 
 you can hear it in the silence 
 you can feel it out, 
 and they said, speak " 
 and you tell me about your dreams. 
 think i see is someone i don't know how it gets better than this 
 you take my eyes and said take it any longer 
 must remember where you are 
 
 i don’t need you now 
 
 oh i’m not scared of anything 
 
 so let me say it real slow 
 
 i hate
