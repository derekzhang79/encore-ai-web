 
 lay down your guns 
 too weak to run sometimes 
 maybe he can't go out and you made a rebel of a careless man’s careful daughter. 
 she is the best thing that’s off you, but it's real. 
 don't remember to be under my skin 
 the bitter sting of our hands 
 the phone and i go back to december, turn around and make it all right. 
 tell me why 
 why, tell me why 
 i miss you but you've been 
 all i hate you more than love you 
 but i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain 
 and it's all good. 
 have a way of the first kiss 
 you can get by with sweet tea and god's graces 
 you can love like a sinner and lose like a winner 
 nothing's shatterproof 
 you can crash and burn and come back someone new 
 and all i wanna do is be next to me 
 all at once, the rest is history 
 
 all the sleepless nights or the endless fights 
 i might hear it got to go back
