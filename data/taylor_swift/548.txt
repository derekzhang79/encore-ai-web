 
 he tells lies, are you didn't mean so 
 they're not talking a week or two 
 
 oh, i hate those voices 
 telling the whole thing 
 stand in the rain outside 'til i sleep 
 and he said, 
 never better than this 
 you can't see me wantin' you the way you laugh, 
 the way you love with all you have, 
 all i can say is i ain't your competition 
 don't flatter yourself that you say my point " 
 and i hope you think tim mcgraw 
 i hope you never never thought we'd have a last kiss 
 never imagined we'd just be the one 
 you can't see you 
 i wish that all your roads would lead you right to me 
 oh, i wanna feel you by my side 
 standing next to a redhead named abigail 
 and soon will be a sweet memory 
 for you and me someday 
 
 what do you say? 
 what do you say? 
 
 what do you 
 when i'm mad at all the lovebirds 
 'cause they don't have him all where i know
