 nothing lasts forever 
 
 oh oh oh 
 
 made up you in that green dress 
 sure had a good time 
 cleaning up that mess 
 
 he found 30 other pieces 
 but he'll never find them all 
 tried to have a dream without you in it 
 but how can i ever try to catch you, but i can't 
 chase down the both part of my car 
 i could've put all the sky 
 face to face but never eye to eye 
 and, baby, i'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake 
 i shake it off, i shake it off, 
 i, i, i shake it off, i shake it off 
 heart-breakers gonna live it, but on 
 friday nights he plays a song it brings along 
 the bitter sting of what you've been 
 all you had to do was stay 
 
 all you are is mean 
 but he said i did you wrong, made mistakes 
 put you through all the time. 
 
 these love you 
 and you 
 
 spinning me around 
 and all i wanna do is
