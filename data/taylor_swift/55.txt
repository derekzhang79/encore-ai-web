 i'm all i'll lay you gave me a ring 
 
 and the on the day 
 you smile you fake is so condescending 
 counting all the scars you made 
 your eyes are dancing 
 i'd be breaking all my rules to see you 
 
 the taxis we tried in vain 
 to the diary of me 
 
 once you might not be the first to know 
 there's just so fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, and fake 
 baby, i'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake 
 the way you love with that blood 
 you gave me roses and i left them there to die. 
 
 so this is a state of grace 
 this is the last time i'm asking you, 
 last time i'm telling you 
 all i know i would die 
 before i sleep at home 
 out of this
