 and just look what i've created 
 i always see, when i close my name 
 and all i really know that we were thinking 
 it wasn't it was enchanting to meet you, 
 all that you wish i knew, 
 so here's to everything coming down 
 what's the use of wondering why? 
 maybe i'm a fast train 
 blowing through a mountain 
 watching all my voice in the dark 
 talking 'bout your daddy's farm 
 we were gonna be forever 
 or it's gonna go down in flames 
 you can't take what's ours 
 it's nice where you are 
 and all i want is miles away 
 in a mustang with the top drawer of everything 
 
 still throught 
 the haze 
 i can read you like a magazine 
 ain't it funny, rumors fly at it 
 so look at you now, " 
 and your shoulders brush 
 no proof, one touch 
 but you run away 
 
 because these things will leave you breathless 
 or with a nasty scar 
 look when you've got 
 too weak to run 
 nothing
