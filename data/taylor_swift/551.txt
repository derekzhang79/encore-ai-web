 after you held me so close 
 but she isn't 
 
 you were the prince 
 i used to fly 
 didn't matter where i'd been 
 but and still the kind of girl 
 who should have seen something you 
 and all i really wanna do is be next to you 
 but for you ever might be leaving 
 i got an i heart question mark, 
 written on the back of my hand 
 all that i don't know you at all. 
 stumbled through the ocean 
 i can’t stop thinking about you 
 i was born free 
 i’m a cell phone hippie 
 are you with me? 
 with you today 
 
 the way we 
 laughed in the dark 
 talking 'bout your daddy's farm 
 and you were romeo, i go 
 and make you realize. 
 
 i just wanna open your eyes 
 sing to you and i 
 
 'cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey! 
 
 are we out of the woods yet? 
 are we out of the woods yet? 
 are we out of the corner 
 or were you
