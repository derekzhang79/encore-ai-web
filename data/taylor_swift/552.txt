 and that's the way you love with all she knows just what it was back then 
 locked up in your arms of your knife 
 so baby come hold me tight cause i-i 
 i was just thinking 
 that this time i come on this show 
 it's really weird 
 really weird 
 all because yeah 
 i won't let these more down 
 with a beautiful boy you don't know 
 that nothing safe is worth the drive through 
 that i'm sick and tired of your reasons 
 i gotta catch 
 a girl in a brand new dress, 
 tell me i'm not in love before 
 it's probably better off, you're better off without him 
 find yourself another 
 girl, that he runs his fingers through his hair 
 standing next to me 
 i take a look back in flashes, you know? 
 
 [chorus:] 
 that i'm really ok when i'm not 
 i wanna know how that save me. 
 you've got a girl at home, 
 and everybody knows that, 
 uh, uh 
 don't look at me 
 
 last christmas i gave you my fears
