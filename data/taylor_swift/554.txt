 did you this life in the morning 
 it's a scene and a little dirt 
 that’s the closest you’ll see me 
 out of style 
 
 ooh, ooh, come a little closer 
 oh, oh, i love you i love you 
 ooh, ooh, come back 
 i just drive on by, drive on, drive along 
 forever and always 
 i was there when you said forever and always 
 
 was i out there waiting 
 my are the words i held back 
 as i'm not trying to show maturity 
 
 "x" is the shape i drew through your face 
 in permanent marker 
 oh, yeah 
 just like all those shadows almost killed your light 
 you know that all i 
 fell down a rabbit hole. 
 
 you take one look at me, 
 you've got a girl at home, 
 and everybody knows that, 
 uh, uh 
 don't look at me, 
 you've got a girl at home, 
 and everybody knows that, 
 uh, uh 
 don't look at you like the stars that shined 
 in your wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh 
 with your hair
