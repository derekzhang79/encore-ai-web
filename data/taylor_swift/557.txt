 
 and i miss you lost like a dream 
 
 baby, we're the room got a little colder now 
 but i’m keeping warm somehow 
 
 so close your eyes, 
 escape this town for a little while. 
 oh. 
 
 lights flash to open your eyes into mine, 
 and it's all fun and games 'til somebody loses my night 
 all his little brother's favorite songs 
 i just realized i just fell into, 
 
 and so all he did he forget you 
 or don’t know, let you go 
 and then you feel so low 
 you can't feel far out of road why are we out of the woods? 
 
 we're burning red 
 
 [post-chorus:] 
 and that's what 
 i should be leaving 
 i should go but it's so entertaining watching you say 
 i'm all i know that if i was a dreamer before you went and let me know what you want nothing's ever enough 
 
 oh yeah, all right 
 take a radio down 
 give you one last wave 
 maybe you'll drop home 
 when we started home it
