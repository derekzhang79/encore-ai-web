 he smiled and i should stay the same. 
 
 i know places 
 
 they are where mine belong and 
 i'll fight their doubt and give you everything you this 
 in only a little while... i'll cry 
 cause you're so much love 
 i'd be breaking all my rules 
 i used to get when you would play 
 and my daddy said, stay real slow 
 'cause it's late and his mama don't know 
 our song is the way you tease 
 and i wanna hate you when i’m out of the church at the back door that i hope you of innocence and i don’t know 
 where i lost control 
 and couldn’t take it any longer 
 must have been somewhere between 
 your smile and the way you love with all you have, 
 i’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door 
 won't finish where you are 
 you were gonna be a movie star 
 and i could tell you his favorite days 
 and i wanted to know how that
