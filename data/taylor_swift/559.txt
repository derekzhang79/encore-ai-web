 i bet you're tired from a long hard week. 
 i bet you're looking for a reason, i know it will 
 make you many friends that i'm obsessive and crazy 
 [album version line:] that's fine i'll tell you i'm insane 
 but i've played 
 we'll just drive down this road and pray it doesn't 
 you should know this week 
 jealousy, misery, gonna give you what you know 
 i'm just sitting here 
 and all i think about is how to be something you miss 
 i watch superman fly away 
 don't know if you gave it to her 
 
 but life's too long 
 to waste it all to shreds

 she got up again 
 she got up again 
 she got up again 
 she got up again 
 the best people in life are free 
 
 do you mean 
 when did you were again, 
 and i'll never (never) be here anyway 
 but you're untouchable 
 burning brighter than the rest
