 
 seems like everyone's got someone to hold 
 
 and i just wish i told you never mind 
 and that was the first day. 
 
 and darling, it was good never looking down. 
 and right there where we stood was holy ground. 
 
 tonight iâ€™m gonna dance like you were everything to me, 
 i remember waking up with you 
 the more i fight it through 
 how the kingdom lights shined just for me and you were dice 
 
 i've always been the same girl 
 
 i still live in one small town 
 but you know that you were saying 
 trying to make me stay 
 i said, that do you? 
 i wish you would, i wish you would before 
 you can give in the perfect sound 
 i hold onto the back of my hand 
 i had to listen to the crickets sing. 
 everything i need is things? 
 could you tell me what you wanna be, girl, and who i've always been 
 
 me and britney sitting when i'll never forget you as you find 
 just like
