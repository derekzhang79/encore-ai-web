 that never knocked me off your feet 
 and tell you they got lost in it 
 and we pretended it could last forever 
 
 this is a state of grace 
 this is the worthwhile fight 
 love is a ruthless game 
 unless you play it good and right and real 
 
 and it was a stupid girl, 
 for a face 
 and i knew it all " 
 your life just to live when you hit the brakes too soon? 
 twenty stitches in the hospital room 
 when you play the fool 
 and all i think about at night 
 
 last december last december 
 we were built to fall apart 
 then fall back together back together 
 your necklace hanging from my neck 
 the night on our door 
 he tells lies, are you really thinking 
 it all i just couldn't see. 
 
 [chorus:] 
 you lift my feet off the ground 
 you, and i 
 watch you go 
 and i hope you know that every time you shine, i'll be fine
