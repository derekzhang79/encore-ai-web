 she said i’m sorry for waking you up but i didn’t know who they are who they always knew this time 
 before the monsters can your big empty town

 come on, come along with me 
 you break my heart slow 
 
 oh, losing him was blue like a one little skirt 
 and when we go crashing down, we come back 
 i just drive on the door 
 
 two headlights shine through the sleepless night 
 and i go back to gave you your eyes 
 she made up waiting at the front gate 
 why some say, some miracle am 
 i don’t try me 
 and i keep all they stay at your backdoor. 
 all this time how could you understand?
