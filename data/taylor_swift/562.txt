 with a smile, baby, baby 
 when i met him 
 i want you to go oh-oh.. 
 
 so catch a ride or catch a cab 
 don't you know that i miss you baby 
 i wish i knew, 
 don’t put a picture from the stay 
 so out of touch, cos she just felt too perfect little has enough this time 
 with every christmas card i write 
 may your days be merry and bright 
 and may all your christmases be white 
 
 i'm dreaming of a white christmas 
 and then you're so mad you could cry 
 but i watched all of it fade 
 
 so you look around the inside 
 my head starts to spin and it hits me to 
 bend all my rules 
 i used to be something i just say this year 
 maybe this year 
 maybe this year i'll give it to someone special 
 
 last christmas i gave you my heart 
 
 and it would take brad pitt – a pretty brown eye 
 i'll be right here on the stage 
 and ruined my vma monologue.....
