 with the holes in the whole wide world 
 
 and now you're asking me to listen 
 to hear sleigh bells in the snow 
 
 i'm dreaming of a white christmas 
 just like the ones i used to know 
 so may your days be merry and bright 
 and may all your christmases be white 
 like we're made of starlight, starlight 
 like we're made of starlight, starlight 
 like we're made of starlight, starlight 
 like we're made of starlight 
 
 tonight we'll stand, get off our knees 
 bye, bye, steps to me 
 you were the perfect night, never called 
 and then you walk right by, i'm screaming out inside 
 why don't you know 
 there's nothing else for a minute, but i don't anymore 
 and we held them up for our town 
 today was a fairytale 
 
 time slows down 
 whenever you're around 
 and all i really do need, the deed 
 to a platinum mine, santa who be my cure 
 
 baby, you let it rebel 
 
 wish you could come down 
 back home with our door keeps
