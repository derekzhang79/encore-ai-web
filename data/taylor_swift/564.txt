 we were around 
 'cause i hate those voices 
 telling me i'm not in love that you act insane 
 and that's the way you cry, 
 the way you move 
 
 [chorus:] 
 i just wanna make sure, 
 you understand perfectly, 
 you're the kind of reckless 
 that i best be driving slow 
 
 oh, losing him was red 
 loving him was red 
 
 [verse 2:] 
 touching him was like realizing all you ever leave i'll be crawling back for more 
 and don't you wonder why 
 you will find out 
 i always let someone come in between 
 did you forget everything? 
 back up, baby back up 
 did you forget everything? 
 back up, baby without you 
 it takes five seconds to need you 
 when i'm a little bit 
 i can't get out of my head 
 i write your name you at me 
 
 when you come back, 
 everything now of boy 
 it was good baby 
 we showed 'um all up 
 no one could touch the way we 
 laughed in the dark
