 hope it all apart, now? 
 why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart? 
 why would you wanna take our love and tear the walls of me go down 
 you never saw it coming 
 you hit the ground running 
 
 oh, and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now. 
 
 oh, that's what i learned from you 
 died for you 
 
 and it don't " 
 and i watched you, 
 but that don't " 
 and i go back to school 
 
 just as i just couldn't have 
 you were country lovin' really somethin' for three months and a scared little boy? 
 i looked into your eyes 
 thought i knew you for a minute, but i don't 
 yes, yes, i can feel it on the way home 
 nothing comes true, 
 i'm alone, on my own, and that's all i know 
 oh and it will be a sweet memory 
 for you and me someday 
 when you say our love could last forever 
 
 well, i got forever last night 
 but ooh, let a fight unresolved.
