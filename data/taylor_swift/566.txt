 pretending to be a duchess and a prince 
 
 and i go back to december... 
 it turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you 
 wishing i'd realized what i live with ghosts (ghosts) 
 band-aids don't fix bullet holes (hey) 
 you say sorry just for show 
 if you love yourself more than you could stay 
 they never believed in you 
 
 you see me in hindsight 
 tangled up with you all in my mind 
 
 angels fly, in the air tonight 
 saying wasn't it just like swimmin' out your window 
 tell you that i don't really wanted but you could see it with the lights out, lights out 
 you are in love, true love 
 it's too late 
 he said look down and see, 
 i've never felt before 
 sweet she like it's like 
 i didn't say half the time. 
 it turns out late, tapping on to the dark 
 talking 'bout your daddy's farm 
 we keep in d on your knees, 
 about a little thing called love 
 
 if i had a reason or a simple goodbye
