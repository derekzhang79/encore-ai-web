 but i have to. 
 i always let someone come in between 
 your talking round the truth and never told her 
 i always knew this time had like 
 i could only find you one last wave 
 maybe you'll drop what you're doing 
 and you said my point " 
 and i go back to all the things you told her 
 
 so you might as well forget my name 
 
 i had the one day i could keep 
 and all you want is to have you. 
 
 ooh-ooh 
 ooh-ooh, ye-e-e-e-eah, hey 
 i should have known it all this time 
 but i know i had the best day 
 
 the way you cuss 
 i keep the keys 
 next the doors were closed at you 
 and look at me 
 and tell me 
 a stranger in an all you wanted 
 you're that just life was never worse but never better 
 eh eh 
 
 we found wonderland 
 you didn't love like a sinner and lose like a winner 
 nothing's shatterproof 
 you can crash and burn and come back
