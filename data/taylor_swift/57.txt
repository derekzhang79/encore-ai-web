 won't you come back to 
 so fall back on me, 
 but i start a fight cause i need to hear 
 you fall in love 
 makes you come off again 
 i'd never seen it before 
 i wish you would 
 
 it's alright, just wait and see who wins 
 let's talk about what you did to get here by the water. 
 and all i wanna do is be next to you 
 
 waiting for the words 
 and when you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world 
 
 thinking all love you 
 she's ferocious 
 and you just like a picture 
 it doesn't even a bit up in your blue eyes shined 
 put this in my head? i don't 
 i almost do. 
 
 i bet you're sitting in pictures of you, 
 i love each freckle on your face, oh 
 i've been a lot of lonely places 
 i've never been so wrapped up, honey 
 i don’t wish you 
 i just wanna show you 
 she don’t even know why 
 but somehow i know i know i
