 bet mama's wondering where we are 
 it's just me and my baby 
 the closer that we get 
 oh, i should've been there in the back of my hand 
 the night we couldn't quite forget 
 when we started home it started to rain 
 and i had it all, what a shame, what a marvelous " 
 it was the best night, never would forget how he moved 
 the whole place was dressed to the nines, 
 and we were gonna buy someday 
 and we were happy 
 
 oh, yeah, yeah 
 
 and i don't wanna come back 
 
 oh, daddy can i go with you? 
 oh, daddy can i go with you? 
 oh, daddy can i go with you? 
 oh, daddy can i go with you? 
 oh, daddy can i go with you? 
 oh, daddy can i go with you? 
 
 come back, come back, come back to me like 
 you out clubbing but i miss you 
 i was begging you, but i like it 
 
 but for me it's just all that out of hands 
 this love is
