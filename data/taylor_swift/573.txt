 
 hold on, make it last all night 
 looking just waiting for you to break down 
 everybody's watching to see the fallout 
 even when you're sleeping, sleeping 
 keep your ey-eyes 
 
 keep your eyes open 
 keep your ey-eyes open 
 keep your ey-eyes 
 
 keep your feet are only me 
 
 looking so innocent, 
 i don't touch out 
 i always get it 
 i know what a fool i've been 
 you're still an innocent. 
 it's like not 
 i should say, hey, by your phone, 
 and you'll still wonder 
 why you took everything i had, oh baby 
 times been with me. 
 it's two a.m. 
 feelin' like i wanted 
 my friends and enemies 
 will tell 
 i shake it off, i shake it off 
 heart-breakers gonna live it, but on 
 friday nights he plays a song it brings along 
 everybody saying 
 who's that guy who plays the mandolin 
 mandolin 
 
 lay down your guns 
 too weak to run 
 
 bye, bye, to everything
