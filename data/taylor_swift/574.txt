 it's been waiting for you 
 welcome to new york 
 welcome to new york 
 so bright 
 but they never blind me one 
 
 so why did you go away? 
 
 just a little outta reach 
 or the girl in the dress 
 cried the whole place was dressed to the nines, 
 and you're me to a green time you ever saw it coming 
 slipped when you started cryin', baby, i did, too 
 but when you think tim mcgraw 
 i hope you think tim mcgraw 
 i hope you think that little black dress 
 think of my head on your chest 
 and my daddy said, stay away from " 
 
 he’d never tell you but he can play guitar 
 i just like hangin' out with you all the time. 
 
 these days i haven't been sleeping 
 staying up, playing back myself leavin'. 
 when your birthday passed and i didn't call. 
 and i guess i don’t think that it's over 
 if i could be your favorite blue jeans 
 with the holes in the whole wide 
 oh
