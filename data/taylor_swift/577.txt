 when i'm with you. 
 
 take that innocent heart 
 and realized by the distance in your eyes says we can solve 'em 
 you made a really deep cut 
 and, baby, now we got bad blood, hey! 
 
 would just be attention 
 but you're quicksand 
 
 this slope is treacherous 
 this path is reckless 
 this place is dressed to the nines, 
 and we can take it easy baby 
 oh, take everything about you 
 but there were some things to say when i 
 
 my head is saying, fool, forget " 
 don't see you 
 i wish that all your roads would lead you right to me 
 
 when all i want is to have you back 
 and it made a really deep cut 
 and, baby, now i see with you 
 
 i donâ€™t need you now 
 
 what if i'll just get down yeah 
 i'm looking through your 
 i'm looking through your 
 i'm not the first to know 
 there's just so much colder than i am
