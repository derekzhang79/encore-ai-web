 baby, i'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake 
 i try to forget when it's all too well 
 if you have children something for a plane of lights that we made? 
 and stars collide in the blue 
 these hands had to let you in 
 
 and we drive and drive 
 
 but that was when i ruled the world 
 
 got his deep brown blue jeans 
 when you think tim mcgraw 
 i hope you think 
 
 [chorus:] 
 well i guess i owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack 
 got myself a big ol serving to pay back 
 i said, that's when i wake up in the morning 
 that's when after sun is always storming 
 laughing when i was just a toy, which you destroyed 
 stupid boy 
 
 [chorus:] 
 well i guess i was a shoulder to cry on 
 
 but i can't believe you made me, 
 but that was when i ruled the world 
 
 come back, come back, come back to me like 
 you hand me
