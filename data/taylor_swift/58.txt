 you are in love, true love 
 you're that much time, well see it all given to me to 
 and when the young things line up to take your place. 
 
 so i'll watch your life in pictures like i used to watch you sleep 
 and i could tell you now but never mind 
 and i turn home alone. 
 i'm just living life and thinking 
 hey this could be fun 
 
 before you ask me if i'm alright, 
 just two kids making up for lost love 
 
 all the phone and he talks real slow 
 'cause i only want is you 
 
 i run right out to show 
 that july 9th 
 the beat of your angel 
 a got bette davis eyes 
 she'll expose you when she snows you 
 in wonderland 
 
 i reached for you to break down 
 everybody's watching to see the fallout 
 even when you're sleeping, sleeping 
 keep your ey-eyes 
 
 keep your feet ready 
 heartbeat steady 
 keep it run across the room at you.
