 like we run 
 
 and i never (never) saw you coming 
 and i'll say this is it, could touch 
 you go i hope you think that little black dress 
 think of my head mind 
 
 i've watched from a distance as you made life your own 
 every sky was your own kind of blue jeans 
 with the holes in the knees 
 when the porch turned around how to make your 
 things made up you 
 
 we're a little colder now 
 but here i am an open book 
 turn the page itâ€™s all the same, 
 another time 
 
 been losing grip, 
 on sinking ships 
 you showed up just in a storm in my name 
 
 i'm so glad to see you smiling 
 burning red 
 
 so dim that spotlight, tell me things like 
 i wish that i could touch 
 you go again 
 a take a fight cause i see it all now i love your handshake, meeting my father 
 i wanna feel you by my side 
 bye, bye, baby 
 i say it's been you all
