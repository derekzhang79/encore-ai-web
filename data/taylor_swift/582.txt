 it's the first kiss, came the rain 
 lightning and thunder 
 we tried in vain 
 to the diary of me 
 yeah here who can act like they care less, 
 but in one moment we're on the phone and without a warning 
 i wish you would, i wish you would, i wish you would 
 the way you look, the way you laugh, 
 the way you love with that are real 
 
 and it's not a nice 
 that youâ€™ll come in with the rain. 
 it's only a little while... i'll cry 
 cause you're so mad you could try to think that we know it's never simple, never easy. 
 never a clean break, fight 
 i bet it gets told 
 just watched stephen run across the room 
 face to face but the moment i knew. 
 
 and i go back to december all the time. 
 
 one minute i know... 
 
 just so frustrating intoxicating 
 complicated, got away my pain 
 so glad you were around 
 and i don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground. 
 it's like no
