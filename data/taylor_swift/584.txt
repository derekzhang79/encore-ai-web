 i just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now 
 i just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now 
 i said, that's when i wake up in the morning 
 that's when we will waiting up to f*ckin' 
 that's when i could finally breathe 
 and by morning 
 you can't live thinking you're all together 
 i know i'm not a little girl in a brand new dress, 
 but if we loved again, i swear i'd like too 
 take this hard to be myself. 
 only you can tell. 
 
 [chorus:] 
 that i'm only up when you're not around 
 'cause i don't hate you but i cried, cried for you 
 and didn't they tell us don't give me choices 
 and that's what these tears are for a little kid 
 i walk with me too 
 
 oh, i miss you and this, 
 come back... be here, come back... be here. 
 i guess it's in the past, these kinda wounds you are worlds away. 
 
 all jerusalem in just living life and so come on
