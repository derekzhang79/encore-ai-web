 i can go 
 cause i'm a singer turned rapper 
 
 i wish you could go back 
 oh baby you hold the key 
 to the diary of me 
 as the sweet 
 wind dances 
 i'll never judge you 
 i can only love you 
 come now running headlong 
 into me, we run with a man 
 and you would say, hey, let's be friends 
 it's just another picture and catch me 
 keep thinking he's the song had it so far out of reach 
 something to come running 
 so catch a ride or catch a cab 
 don't you know that what i feel is true. 
 and i'm only me when i'm with you. 
 
 stay, stay, stay. 
 thought i knew you for a minute, but i don't anymore 
 
 and i stare at the phone 
 he still hasn't called 
 and then you come around 
 'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile 
 don't you wonder about me 
 how i gave up all 
 i'll never judge you 
 i do 
 
 turn on, come
