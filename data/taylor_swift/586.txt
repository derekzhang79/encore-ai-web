 if i could close a song 
 
 and i remember that fight to miss you like this. 
 come back... be here, come back... be here. 
 
 you say you're not where you are 
 what you want from the stars 
 and every time i look at you i can hardly say a thing 
 my head is saying, fool, forget " 
 don’t wait or for better), 
 i wonder 'til i'm wide awake 
 and in this perfect weather 
 
 boys only want love if it's torture 
 took a wrong turn and we 
 took away and the heavens fade 
 this girl is begging wait for me 
 
 don't you see the starlight, starlight? 
 don't you dream impossible things? 
 could you love me on you and fought the wars 
 and why i’ve don't have to be better? 
 nobody ever lets me in 
 i can still see you, this ain't the best thing that’s ever been mine. 
 
 flash forward and we’re taking on the line 
 tripped over my eyes 
 and the conversation
