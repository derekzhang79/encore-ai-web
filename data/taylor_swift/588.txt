 you say we’ll never make my parents’ mistakes. 
 
 got this in the best sound of our lives 
 but something we better, 
 do you even care? 
 to cross above my head 
 but i was just a toy, which you destroyed 
 stupid boy 
 
 let me know, like, 
 that i can withstand 
 the weight of the world alone 
 if i could be your favorite blue jeans 
 and i know everything about you

 think of all the boys i haven't kissed

 but i can't you turn in one moment 
 maybe i never felt since i think about at night 
 and i could be your little beauty queen 
 just a little outta reach 
 or the girl living next door 
 i'll be here, today and here tomorrow 
 in dark blue tennessee 
 
 she almost called 
 here.
