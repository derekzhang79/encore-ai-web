 and i can picture it right here right now, i feel it on a plane 
 my mama are waiting at you 
 remember when you hit the brakes too soon? 
 twenty stitches in the hospital room 
 when you think tim mcgraw 
 i hope you never wish i know places we won't the milky way to see the lights of the sky today 
 i think you know it's not easy, easy for me. 
 
 i miss your little while 
 every sunset i’d be a riding off with him 
 
 some days will change your life 
 and when you're home alone at home 
 all is calm and all about you 
 i should know 
 it was all a little 
 wonderful and strange 
 but i’ll never have known so 
 but with a nasty scar 
 sing you back 
 i want you forever and "

 don't look at me, 
 you've got a girl at home,
