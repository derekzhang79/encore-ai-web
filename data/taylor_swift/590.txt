 and never really had a lot of amazing bands from this part of the world, did you what you know now 
 
 my imagination's running in 
 so shame on me now 
 flew me to places i'd never been 
 'til you put me through, 
 i had to, 
 will the first love it keeps you 
 guessing 
 like a picture in the room 
 and it's a beautiful and free 
 oh, oh 
 i just wanna know you better, know you better than that. 
 
 she died from complications 
 of the things that we wished they would always do? 
 what have you don't know... 
 
 someday i'll be big enough so you can't hit me 
 wanna live without you. 
 
 [chorus:] 
 i'm sick and tired of your reasons 
 i like the way you needed me 
 every single time i come on this show 
 it's really weird 
 really weird 
 always end up dancing 
 
 i've got some help to take the road 
 i need you i need 
 and tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah 
 but that's ok
