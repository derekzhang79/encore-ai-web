 and emily – she's fading " 
 
 he said, i got me a nice new apartment 
 in a twin sized bed 
 you are the way you kiss, the way you needed me 
 every time the things got rocky, yeah 
 
 my name is up in lights, i see you found somebody new 
 so catch a cab, 
 lose my number, 
 let's consider this lesson learned. 
 
 don't look at me, 
 you've got a lying smile i never put out for you 
 
 this is a state of grace 
 this is the last time i'm asking you, 
 last time i'm only me when i'm with you. 
 
 and we drive and drive 
 
 hey, all you got all they take my eyes off of you 
 we are never getting back together 
 you go talk to your friends you ain't seen the way you say my name 
 i can’t win so i give in this here today 
 
 everyday 
 there's no, no 
 you're not sorry 
 no, no, no in another 
 oh that you see 
 i'll rock this fire
