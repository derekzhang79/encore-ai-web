 stupid boy 
 
 [chorus:] 
 well i guess i owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack 
 you ever wanted was right there in front of you saying, i'm sorry for that night 
 it's in a since 
 
 i never fall in love he wrote 
 you're my love and all i really wanted cause i heard, oh, yeah 
 i’m gonna dance like you were in this room. 
 but i don’t need you now or like a first kiss 
 you imagined i'll be fine without you 
 but i have to. 
 
 the delicate beginning rush, 
 the feeling for you 
 
 but i miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile, 
 so catch a ride or catch a cab 
 don't you look in my name 
 i can’t win so i know i've been a real time 
 dreaming dreams with happy endings 
 in backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords 
 but now we've stepped into a cruel world 
 where everybody stands and keeps score 
 
 keep your ey-eyes open 
 keep your ey-eyes 
 
 keep your feet
