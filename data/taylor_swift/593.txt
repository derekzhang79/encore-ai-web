 we don't have a " 
 i hope these songs will remind me 
 you were the prom queen, i was on this stage 
 so where's that crown gotten you these days? 
 when it's with me to all about the lovebirds 
 'cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you 
 and they are there always a so take a chevy 
 
 so you deserve some applause 'cause you're so much better than you 
 i pull out the drive 
 it's ain't only a day today 
 that was as i light up 
 why don't you tell me 
 to be nice 
 i'm not a little girl anymore 
 trying in the lie 
 american boy, raising little babies 
 hearing daddy maybe, i'll be like you 
 suddenly life, seems just like a girl in his eyes 
 heâ€™ll never fall in love 
 it's too late to be brand new 
 
 it's a new soundtrack 
 i could go back and tell yourself there 
 all that you were 
 stripped to the bone 
 i thought i had you figured out
