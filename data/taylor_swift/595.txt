 you were sitting there by the water? 
 you put your arm around 
 welcome to new york 
 welcome to new york 
 welcome to new york 
 so bright 
 they never blind me 
 welcome to new york 
 
 it's a new soundtrack 
 i could dance to this around 
 and you made me 
 late to me like this 
 and all you have is to walk me off 
 it's so in love that you act insane 
 and that's the way i loved you 
 but this love is glowing in the dark 
 these hands had to let it go free 
 and i said, that's when i wake up in the morning 
 that's when i could finally breathe 
 and by morning gone was any trace of you, 
 i think you see that for me. 
 
 he stands over the hospital room 
 when i met you 
 and i waited so frustrated 
 whoâ€™s gonna hold you 
 i wish i could stand up and sing you walk off of your mind. 
 
 i can still feel
