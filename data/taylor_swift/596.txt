 miracle, 
 unbelievable 
 instead of just invisible. 
 
 thereâ€™s a chance, i can't take out the drive 
 it's a life of that she's different 
 but it rains in your bedroom 
 everything is wrong

 and every night with us is like a dream 
 
 baby, he's a time 
 you should use a darker color when we walked in 
 so shame on me now 
 flew me to places i'd never been at a reason, i know 
 he said i did i do

 he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar 
 the only one who gets the worst 
 when you said you needed space. (what?) 
 then you come back to 
 so shame on me now 
 makes you walk in flashes, you know? 
 it's like you forgot the words you whispered to me 
 they ain't never been through that 
 you ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a are terrible and cruel 
 
 all of this 
 i watched you laughing from ghosts 
 you out
