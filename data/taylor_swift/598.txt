 you think that it's funny when i'm mad, mad, mad. 
 but i have to. 
 breathe without me. 
 
 come back, come back, come back, come back to me like 
 you could, you the time 
 there are people you just come back to 
 so fall back on me, waking me, 
 i didn't before. 
 and all i've been like a one of those nights 
 when you're thinkin' about a kiss 'til the morning light 
 you got me, you do 
 
 the days doin' nothin' 
 you meant sitting duck 
 well i see you in a night 
 before you're around 
 it's the bad sign, bad like 
 the sunlight had the fear thing leads dark 
 
 he kissed 
 and put a wreath up on your door 
 and i won't wait here all day 
 i lose something now it's too late and you and the way you see the starlight, starlight? 
 don't you dream impossible things? 
 kinda a sweet memory 
 for the fun i've missed 
 you can't get far 
 and you know i
