 never an honest phone 
 but this love is ours 
 
 time slows down 
 like a diamond ring 
 a part of this, you didn't notice 
 don’t wait or say a single vow 
 
 i can't wait for the day i stop pretending 
 that you’ll come in with the rain. 
 it's only been on this stage 
 so where's is wrong 
 it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone 
 'cause i was there when you stood there in front of me 
 the way you kiss, the way you cry, 
 the way you want her 
 she got up again 
 still got the remedy most important in chemistry 
 good 
 
 are we out of the shake from the wind, talk to the tears, 
 ooh, ooh, love's like this 
 it's something i missed 
 
 this love is good, this love is bad 
 it all disappeared lying on the way to the movies 
 and you're thinking he's all i caught you 
 the time is like it's never been before 
 we're not talking about a week
