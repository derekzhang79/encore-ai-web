 all the sleepless nights or the endless fights 
 i never talked about the tears i cried 
 all the sleepless nights or the endless fights 
 i never saw it coming, 
 heard to see it made her 
 you made a really deep cut 
 and baby, now i know 
 all i can say whole time you lose yours 
 you keep your coat 
 look made your name 
 and so it's just me and my baby 
 the closer that we get 
 look at all this wasted time 
 did you feel this magic i've been feeling since i met you. 
 can't turn back 
 there's a shortcut to the highway out of 
 not this time 
 but i never been on a plane 
 and i hope sometimes you wonder about me. 
 it's like you forgot the words you whispered to me 
 you have an excellent father 
 his strength is making me stronger 
 god smiles on my down 
 
 wasn't it easier in your firefly-catchin' days? 
 when everything out of reach, someone bigger brought down 
 i love you, but you were with anyone
