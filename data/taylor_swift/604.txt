 all i know, can you tell me now, you’re the yeah... 
 
 and i wish you took me with you... 
 
 and time is taking its sweet time erasing you

 i'd rather live a life of gold with a perfect chick 
 cause that one moment when i wake up in the morning 
 that's when after sun is always storming 
 laughing when i let all one more be good and right
