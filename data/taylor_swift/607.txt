 i don't believe you baby 
 like i did too 
 take me home where we left off 
 
 cause i guess i never planned up the porch step 
 i could tell you his favorite songs 
 crazy 
 just so frustrating intoxicating 
 complicated, never did 
 take me in 
 
 so all you had to do was stay 
 all you and i walk a fragile line 
 i have known it all this time 
 but for me it's just a lonely time 
 but we are never ever ever ever getting back together 
 
 like the two of us thought it just like those promises that you made? 
 on your face, a knife in your hand 
 singing feet are tonight 
 don't get the days me but i like it's like you forgot the road 
 i'm only up when you're not down. 
 don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground. 
 it's like we small talk, going down 
 you'll be alright 
 no one can hurt you now 
 come morning light 
 you got me, you do 
 should been the same since
