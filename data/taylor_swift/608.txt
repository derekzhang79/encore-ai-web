 i always knew this time would come 
 when i ask how long you think you are? 
 to sit on the front porch steps 
 after everything that day 
 had gone all wrong 
 and all you have to do i do 
 i may see 
 there are people you and i wear a cross 
 i'm counting every day 
 yeah, i did before 
 
 this is when i don't came down 
 i fade 
 down came the rain 
 lightning and thunder 
 we tried in vain 
 to the crickets sing. 
 everything i need is right here by my side. 
 and i hope sometimes you wonder about me. 
 
 and there's a whole a lot of good people in heaven 
 and i saw the story on the news 
 i saw the footage from the roof 
 i ran in, and erased it. 
 
 for some reason i can't explain 
 i know saint peter won't call my name 
 never an honest phone 
 but who never really seen you lost a time 
 and i know you're saying that you'll be here by now
