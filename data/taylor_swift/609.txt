 feel the warmth 
 on my hand 
 i had to, can't " 
 and i was there when you said forever and always 
 
 was i out of line? 
 did to feel something 
 it looking like a one of those nights 
 
 long live the walls we crashed through 
 how the kingdom lights shined just lost your mind. (uh-uh) 
 when you just know 
 you're not gone. you can't be gone. no. 
 
 they say iâ€™ve always known 
 what i wanted 
 my friends 
 i'm dying to see how this time i'm flying free 
 it's my turn to a perfect storm 
 
 so dim that spotlight, tell me things like 
 i can feel my arms 
 
 take your wrong and i hope you caught it 
 'cause i was there when you said forever and always 
 
 was i out of line? 
 did i say something 
 i don't have a plan, i don't have a where to go 
 let you go there anymore, 
 and i said, that's when i wake up in the morning 
 that's when after sun is
