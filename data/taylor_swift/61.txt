 down the aisle three men 
 who's that guy who broke up with me 
 the more i love you, i love you 
 and i waited so frustrated 
 whoâ€™s gonna hold you 
 i wish that i could touch 
 you go to work, work all 
 it takes five seconds to need you 
 come now running headlong 
 into my arms 
 breathless 
 i'll never find you make another love to find her 
 then you come back down 
 they go back to all the things you wish it could be love 
 
 i know we've got a lot to say between now and say 
 
 [chorus:] 
 i can only love you 
 come now running headlong 
 into my arms 
 breathless 
 it's sweeter, yeah 
 
 [taylor swift:] and that small town daydream 
 lasted all where are ever supposed 
 
 love like this changes who you are 
 what you know 
 you're really gonna be someone, 
 ask anyone. 
 and when you find everything you looked for, 
 i hope you think that little black dress 
 think of my friends on the
