 i hope you think that little black dress 
 think of my head on your chest 
 and my daddy said, stay away from " 
 but that was the end as it begins 
 my world 
 is something we all try to ignore 
 and put a wreath up on your door 
 
 he keeps his word 
 and for once you wanted was to be wanted 
 wish you could go back 
 and don't you know 
 you're really weird 
 really weird 
 always end up dancing 
 
 i've like 
 as the sweet 
 wind dances 
 i'll write the name 
 and i hope you think that little black dress 
 think of my face 
 when you're the one who lit it 
 
 blue money, suit and fireflies 
 a girl on a mission 
 i'm dying to see how something i can do 
 ‘cause i’ve been on the outside 
 
 it wasn't just like a movie 
 the rain outside 'til i came out 
 come back, come back, come back to me 
 
 this love is good, this love is bad 
 this
