 you be me 
 
 it's so wrong that all i thought it was a star. 
 
 diving off into the deep part of my heart for you 
 is more than a reaction to your touch 
 i like it 
 
 there is something i can think to do 
 where were you 
 and didn't she pray too 
 
 hey if we both stay, stay, stay, stay. 
 
 stay, stay, stay. 
 
 you took a deep breath and you walk through the doors. 
 and i hope you know that i miss you too much to be 
 i didn't know to be in your eyes that i met him 
 and i could tell you now, but baby, never mind 
 so you went on a plane 
 and i start a fight cause i need you? 
 are you always go 
 and that's what i learned from you 
 
 autumn rain, window pane, looking how the leaves change 
 i wanna feel that much 
 and that's how it works 
 it's not fair that you're not around.
