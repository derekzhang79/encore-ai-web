 
 i gave you all of my time 
 
 just close your eyes 
 the sun is going down 
 we could be just as good 
 if you check off me. 
 you made a broken heart you left me " 
 as weâ€™re looking good 
 
 oh, yeah, all right 
 i'd be a game if you go 
 it's beating in my way 
 
 we were sitting there by the water? 
 you put your arm around me for the skies 
 left to travels, lives they unravel 
 mind me when you " 
 
 ha! 
 losing him was blue like i'd be a riding off with him 
 
 all around the world 
 and i know you're not scared of anything at all 
 and so you got a mean streak 
 makes me run for a white christmas 
 just like the ones i used to know 
 where the hell don't you need me like i need you? 
 are you out up this 
 
 small town daydream 
 lasted all night 
 cussing out all those bright city lights 
 just look at
