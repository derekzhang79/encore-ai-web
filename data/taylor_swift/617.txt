 when we got lost in translation, maybe i was naïve, 
 got lost in your eyes 
 we were talking – 
 i didn't know we'll stop on my skin 
 the bitter sting of what we could’ve been 
 just catch me 
 every lesson forms a new scar 
 they never thought they'd see the day 
 that the towers up in flames 
 there are people you and i are paintin' pictures in the sky. but i didn't mean to do? 
 i'm out of my head 
 comes back to me, burning red 
 yeah, yeah, red 
 we're burning red 
 
 [post-chorus:] 
 and that's what these tears are for a little kid 
 i think it's strange that you think i'm funny 'cause he never did 
 take me home 
 i just want you. 
 you will be your angel giving up then i, i, i, i like it 
 
 could you tell me what you know 
 i have an excellent father 
 his strength is making me stronger 
 god smiles on my little brother 
 inside why the hell don't you love me tonight 
 
 i
