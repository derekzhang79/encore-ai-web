 and i played you for for a little while you wanted 
 
 [chorus:] 
 
 oh what a shame, what a fall now 
 but in my life you'll see me in hindsight 
 tangled up with our love to last forever 
 
 and you'll know you 
 and every time i can go 
 should turn back now, i'm haunted 
 
 we found wonderland 
 you and i got lost in your eyes 
 the song is the back on 
 got more a smile 
 you should use a darker color when i was wrong 
 and i don't wanna turn around 
 coz i'm not scared 
 of quite like brought up you got that to you 
 
 i hear me out of this joint 
 come on, come along with me 
 the best people in life are free 
 
 and i wish i could close your eyes 
 the sun is going down 
 when i'm with you 
 ever knew 
 that i'm the one of them 
 i'm just living life and thinking 
 when we started home
