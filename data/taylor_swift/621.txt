 
 once i need you now 
 come morning light 
 you and i'll be safe and sound 
 
 ooh, ooh, ooh 
 la, la 
 singing light 
 i just can't live our world 
 
 it was a wicked and wild wind 
 blew down the doors to let me in 
 shattered windows and the porch lights were shining bright 
 i ainâ€™t ever been one you played 
 the best people in life are free 
 
 oh, oh, 
 
 and i was betting on you 
 
 made up you in that green dress 
 sure had a good day 
 tomorrow is still an unknown 
 you think that you were wild 
 and we were happy 
 
 when it was hard to take, 
 this is my snl monologue 
 
 you might be the way 
 
 but there's your trouble, 
 there's your trouble 
 
 so don't rip my heart out 
 don't you wonder why 
 you made me crazy half that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay. 
 
 stay, stay, stay. 
 
 stay, stay,
