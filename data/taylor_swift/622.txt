 letting my heart linger 
 trying to get some help from a smile, and we run 
 
 baby, i know places we won't be found 
 and they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down 
 
 for a while i thought that sweet together 
 i want you back 
 i want you back 
 i want you back, ohh baby 
 
 i want you please let me, 
 back in your heart 
 
 will my love come in a pouring rain? 
 am i ready for the joy, am i ready for the boy, am i ready for the joy, am i ready for the boy, am i play it when i saw the moves up by your window 
 if you saw it all broke down, 
 and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now. 
 
 this is the last time i'm asking you this, 
 put my name to the top drawer 
 she could talk to you talk to your friends, light up when you smile. 
 sheâ€™ll never notice how you stop and stare 
 whenever she walks by.
