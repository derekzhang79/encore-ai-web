 yesterday was never worse but never better 
 eh eh 
 
 eh [5x] 
 in wonderland 
 eh [5x] 
 in wonderland 
 eh [5x] 
 in wonderland 
 eh [5x] 
 in wonderland 
 eh [5x] 
 in wonderland 
 i had it all back 
 
 i know for you, it's always me 
 i know places 
 
 they are the hunters, we are the foxes 
 and we were dancing, dancing 
 like we're made no, no one to believe in 
 you ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack 
 
 can't believe the time you lost me 
 can't turn back now, i'm haunted 
 
 i know, i know places we could work it out somehow 
 but that was when i ruled the world 
 
 thinking all the words to your old favorite song 
 sweet months 
 and i know since yesterday is everything has changed 
 
 do you mean what you say? 
 
 once when you say our love could last forever 
 why don't you break my heart slow 
 now baby don't you break my mind when i saw you
