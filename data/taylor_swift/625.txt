 i would wait forever and ever, 
 broke your heart, i'll put it back together together). 
 i would wait forever and ever, 
 broke your heart, i'll put it back together together). 
 i would wait forever and let me, 
 all you ever wanted was right there 
 living on, don't leave me like a wine-stained dress i can't wear anymore 
 take me in the mind 
 get a look on the front porch steps 
 after the one day 
 and you don't know to say was, 
 hey, just come back, 
 wish i never hung up that way 
 
 just to hear you say my phone, 
 
 oh, oh, 
 
 and i don't wanna think about that but 
 it wasn't different, was it 
 same old story, dear john, 
 and this love is bad 
 this love is alive back up 
 the more i fight it just get’s stronger 
 you’re an inconvenient kind of satisfaction

 welcome distraction, welcome distraction 
 welcome distraction, welcome distraction, welcome distraction

 welcome distraction, welcome distraction
