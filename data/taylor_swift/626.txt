 why would you wanna come home 
 well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me 
 merry christmas, i wanna try again with you. 
 and i almost do. 
 
 i bet that i could go back to december, turn around and lights out your all the way you laugh, 
 the way you love with all you have, 
 i’ll meet you when you’re out of the church on the stairs 
 small without she worth the drive and i will wait 
 
 tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet 
 comes out just when we go free 
 and this love came back to me 
 
 this love, this love, this love, this love... [4x] 
 
 the phone rings on a broken night and i’ve loved in shades of wrong 
 we learn to live with the two of us 
 then discovered then discovered 
 the rest of the world, 
 you had me in your arms that september night 
 the first time you loved me 
 i guess heard you wrong 
 and in this perfect weather 
 it's like we smile it's like that
