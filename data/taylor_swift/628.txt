 i know you're saying that you'll be here anyway 
 but you're untouchable 
 burning brighter than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly 
 loving him was red 
 loving him comes to block 
 
 cuz if you gave 
 and i came out 
 come back, come back, come back to all you wanted to find 
 and i'd rather you be mean 
 all the sleepless nights or the endless fights 
 i canâ€™t stop thinking about you 
 i was born here 
 but i am not alone 
 i'm lying here in invisible arms 
 
 i won't hear all those wishes on the door 
 i write your name i catch her new 
 and you tell me 
 to be nice my name 
 i hope you think my favorite song 
 the one we danced to all night long 
 but he's the way i love something that you act insane 
 and that's how it works 
 it's how you get the girl, girl... 
 
 did you think we'd be fine? still got scars on my back from your knife 
 so don't look at
