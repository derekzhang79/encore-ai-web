 were everything that i have to do this week 
 jealousy, misery, gonna give you what you gave me a ring 
 
 and when love ever does 
 run 
 run to the back of my hand 
 all my friends are saying 
 do you see when you're not pretty that well 
 i won't quite forget where you are 
 i don’t wanna dance if i’m not dancing 
 
 what a sad beautiful tragic love affair 
 
 we had a lot of amazing bands from this part of the world, did you know that? 
 
 we know what a marvelous " 
 it was the best night, never would forget how he tries 
 and what the real world 
 trying just to get the girl 
 begging for forgiveness, begging for me 
 
 i’m poetry, complicated 
 simply stated 
 hey yeah baby how about you 
 i was trying so hard like a record that's much 
 when i looked at you like the time. 
 this place is too much 
 and another winter's on the way 
 your eyes are 
 
 i got tired of waiting
