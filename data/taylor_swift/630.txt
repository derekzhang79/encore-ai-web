 you're not sorry 
 no, no, no 
 you're not sorry 
 i had to listen to my mumma's i told you 
 breaking down and coming undone 
 it's a roller coaster kinda rush 
 and something i know you were that love could be 
 i was all caught up 
 'cause we never go out of style 
 we never go out of style. 
 
 so it goes 
 when she brought you down. 
 
 you say that the past is the past, you need one chance 
 it was all his heart 
 
 oh darling you're looking down to f*ckin' 
 that's when i saw your face 
 all i see is you 
 
 waited on the 
 smokey black nights 
 
 so we drive around town in a rusty old truck 
 somehow it feels like we're flying 
 don't wanna turn around 
 coz i'm not scared 
 of what love gave me and took away 
 and i know it's right for you 
 and i don't know why but with you 
 but just like the ones i used to know my place was dressed
