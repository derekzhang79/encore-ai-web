 growing up and falling in love in the cruelest way, 
 this is the last time i'm asking you, 
 last time i'm asking you this, 
 put my name at the top of your list, 
 you break my heart in the blink of the doubt, every single time 
 and not remember what you wanna play our song 
 i wish that pretty girls couldn't see you 
 i wish i could go on and on, on and on 
 the rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin 
 the bitter sting of what we wanted 
 
 [chorus:] 
 that i'm only up when you're not down. 
 don't wanna come back 
 wish i never hung up the phone and she whispers back, 
 
 missing you like this is such in a faded 
 every sky 
 i relax; look at me 
 and tell me, did venus blow your dreams 
 and there's nothing about and you and i 
 
 do you believe in me 
 
 every single time 
 and then you walk in here with a broken heart you left me "
