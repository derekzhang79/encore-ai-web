 
 rain came pouring down when i was drowning 
 that's when i could finally breathe 
 and by morning gone was any trace of you, 
 i can't help but wish you took our place 
 the meaning of love so nobody breaks my perfect fantasy 
 i realize you 
 i was there when you say goodbye 
 the cracks down the middle 
 can't see you again 
 
 i say, let you and i 
 
 'cause, baby, i could build a castle 
 out of style 
 
 all you are is not where you are 
 your smile and the way you wanted me 
 every night for so long, baby 
 i like the way you needed me 
 every time the things got rocky, yeah 
 
 do you mean what you know 
 all i know 
 oh i'm just a girl, trying to let you take her home, it whets her appetite 
 she'll lay you on the throne, she got bette davis eyes 
 she'll turn the music on you, you loved me 
 
 it would take brad pitt in you. 
 and
