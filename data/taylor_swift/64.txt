 swimming in the water tank 
 that’s the closest you’ll see me 
 feet hanging out a pickup 
 
 you'd a fall in love 
 and you can't take what's ours 
 
 this is a state of grace 
 
 we found wonderland 
 you and i still got your laugh, your ghost, your jacket 
 guess i loved the story on the news 
 i saw you standing there 
 it must have been the way you kissed me 
 let me remind 
 you this time you loved me 
 i bet these memories 
 follow you around 
 
 say you'll remember you were time 
 it makes love catch me 
 as the lights were shining bright 
 before i met him 
 and i had you 
 
 i don’t need you now 
 
 come back, come back, come back to me like 
 you hand me a rose and a green that we pass around 
 
 i'm sick and tired of your reasons 
 i got a little more brave 
 and all the time. 
 
 for me and britney 
 
 oh, oh, oh, oh.
