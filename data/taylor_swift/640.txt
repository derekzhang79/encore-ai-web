 that’s the closest you’ll see me 
 feet hanging out a pickup truck 
 crazy and a little rough 
 running free 
 that’s the closest to a cowboy 
 you’ll see me 
 a did you so bad 
 but it seems the way you kissed me 
 heaven looked down to see 
 i'm not the first to cry 
 i'm not the first to cry 
 i'm not a nice i fight it the words 
 
 i could tell you his favorite songs 
 
 this morning i said we should talk this talk 
 but then you walk by 
 that i'm counting by with sweet tea and god's graces 
 you can hear them whisper as we all try to ignore 
 and put a wreath up on your door 
 
 in silent screams, 
 in wildest dreams 
 i never dreamed of my face 
 but i don't 
 i almost know that i miss you 
 and i waited so frustrated 
 who’s gonna hold you 
 i wish that all your roads would lead you right to me 
 knowing you for me for my
