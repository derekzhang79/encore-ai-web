 i can feel 
 there's something i missed 
 and our mamas smiled 
 and rolled their eyes and said oh oh, oh, oh 
 there was nothing i stay at it 
 
 never blow away girl 
 living in the crazy world 
 i've always been 
 
 i don't wanna miss you like this, 
 come back... be here, come back... be here. 
 
 you say that you'd take it all go down 
 they like it's like a picture in the room 
 i'm spinning around, i'm spinning around 
 and all i can think that you should go with me 
 
 every single time i let you take her home, it whets her appetite 
 she'll lay you on the throne, she got bette davis eyes 
 she'll expose you when she snows you 
 she knows you, she's got bette davis eyes 
 she'll turn the mandolin 
 mandolin 
 
 but if you wake up in the morning 
 that's when after sun is always storming 
 laughing when i was just a toy, which you destroyed 
 stupid boy 
 
 [chorus:] 
 donâ€™t say yes", run away now,
