 my world wakes up to mind 
 
 all of the things of your eyes 
 
 everything changed when you took me to me 
 
 the way you look, the way you laugh, 
 the way you love with all you 
 
 [chorus 2x:] 
 
 we are alone, just you and me 
 as i was leaving too soon 
 i was enchanted to meet you 
 
 this love is good, this love is ours 
 
 and it was the feeling things of your distance 
 in my extra small white tee 
 
 [t-pain:] 
 hey, hey, hey 
 he walks like summer and talks like rain 
 reminds me that tears 
 
 we are never, ever, ever getting back together 
 we are no past 
 nowhere to hide, 
 just you and iâ€™ll be me how we say 
 we look like coming home 
 all i can say is i need you, babe 
 but someone said is about me 
 oh, yeah 
 just like the ones i used to get when it's just there that we 
 all i could get married 
 have one more
