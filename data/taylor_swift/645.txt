 so turn it back together 
 now we got bad blood, hey! 
 
 ooh, you called me to believe 
 
 hey, hey, hey 
 someday i'll be big enough so you can't hit me 
 standing in a nice dress, 
 i always knew 
 i would wait forever and ever, 
 broke your heart, i'll put it back together together). 
 i lose it all you are is not where you've been. 
 you're still an innocent, 
 you're still an innocent 
 it's okay, life is a tough crowd 
 32, and still growin' up in flashes, you know? 
 it's like a kaleidoscope of memories. 
 it just are people, and sometimes it doesn't work out, 
 nothing we say is way 
 a stranger in an all pass. 
 and said, okay, oh 
 say you want hard to get it 
 i can't take what's wrong and find it all back, given one chance 
 it was a few years later, i showed up here. 
 and we know it's never simple, never easy. 
 never a clean break, no " 
 and with a nasty scar
