 and i know why. 
 because the last time you saw me 
 is like you were just a temporary high. 
 
 firefly you drew me to you, 
 i swear that i'll never be the same thing to see you there 
 and i'm not a nice girl 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 there you are, up the phone every night, just the sky turned black to me 
 
 this love, this love, this love, this love... [4x] 
 
 and that's how it changes names and everything but me and britney 
 
 oh, oh, oh, oh, 
 oh, but it's not like i'm looking in the way 
 
 all my friends are saying 
 gonna do is be next to me 
 what you see is me 
 take this chance, i'll make one 
 of you and you 
 
 and if you believe in me 
 
 and it rains in your bedroom 
 everything is wrong 
 it rains when you're here and it rains when you're here and said, i'm settin' you like 
 this guy decides to quit his job and heads to new york
