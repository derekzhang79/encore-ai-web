 
 tell me,oh 
 
 hold on, make it this " 
 
 and when we go crashing down, we come back every time 
 'cause we never had one to settle like 
 the dust does on the dash 
 since the feeling ain’t strong 
 i’ll just move their minds 
 but that 
 
 and that small town daydream 
 lasted all so tired of everything 
 and i wish that i could touch 
 you go i hope you think that little black dress 
 think of my head on your chest 
 and my daddy said, stay away from " 
 
 he says, baby girl, what's wrong with " 
 you said, i hate " we break up, but there's never enough 
 and whispers on the street 
 when you come back, come back to me like 
 you go once been just like her. 
 
 do you say you love em, and as i am 
 
 "x" is the shape i drew through your face 
 in permanent marker 
 oh, yeah 
 just like the mark you knew you were making 
 who do you think you are?
