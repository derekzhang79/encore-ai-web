 i almost caught up 
 and the people as they leave you breathless 
 or with a nasty scar 
 got a long of it 
 let's wait for that 
 locked up in your arms crossed 
 it's something you should know that is for sure 
 christmas must be something 
 christmas must be something more 
 
 there's gotta be more 
 the front porch steps in a faded light 
 well i read you should never leave a fight unresolved. 
 that's when you thought you're 'bout to cry. 
 i was enchanted to meet you, i can teach you 
 all i know, can you come back to 
 so may your days 
 give me a reason why i touch 
 
 the taxis pulled up all alone 
 i'll spend forever wondering if you knew 
 this night is flawless, don't you let it go 
 i'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way you kissed me 
 fell in love when i saw you standing there 
 it must have been the way 
 
 but i can't believe you made me, 
 but i'd never seen it before 
 i wish
