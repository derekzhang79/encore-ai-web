 i used to fly 
 didn't matter where i'd been 
 a little pathway headed for the first time. 
 you have an excellent father 
 his strength is making me stronger 
 god smiles on my little brother 
 inside i still donâ€™t love you 
 and it's looking like a one of those nights 
 you can hear it 
 i was a dreamer before you went and let me down, 
 something 'bout your friends 
 and if you come around 
 i'm counting every word 
 but i feel you forget me like i used to watch the sun go down 
 on the boats in the water 
 that's when i saw your face 
 to let me in, baby that's when 
 
 last christmas i gave you my heart 
 but the chain on your neck 
 he says, baby girl, it's not an angel at the other girls has last 
 not the time i can see you years from now 
 but i'll never known now, it's all good. 
 i wish you would 
 to realign a star or two 
 change a southern night every night, change
