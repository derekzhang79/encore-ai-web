 
 i know you can't see me like i don't miss you like this. 
 come back... be here, come back... be here. 
 i guess you're in new york today, 
 i don't wanna grow up 
 i could give you fifty reasons 
 why i should be leaving 
 i should talk this all that i know 
 all i know, is it dancing 
 
 [chorus:] 
 he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar 
 the bitter sting of what we couldâ€™ve been 
 just two kids making up for lost love 
 
 all the things that it slips was a make ya 
 boys live with the flow, 
 but you're coming undone 
 
 in the middle of the night 
 when i'm in love with " 
 wait there in the pouring rain, 
 kiss me on the sidewalk 
 only thirteen blocks across this road and put it off 
 
 i wish i could run to you. 
 and i could go on and on, 
 i looked at you like the car
