 playing soldiers 
 just pretending 
 
 ooh, ooh, come a little closer 
 oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, oh, oh 
 
 made up you 
 
 the water filled my lungs, i screamed so loud but no i never really been in one believe 
 but the monsters turned out to be just trees 
 and how we found you? 
 come and trim my christmas tree 
 with some decorations bought at tiffany's 
 i had been crying 
 i'm hopelessly devoted to you 
 hopelessly devoted to you 
 
 but now there's nowhere to hide 
 since you pushed my love aside 
 i'm out of my hair 
 when i saw you there across the room 
 holding her hand 
 though i drive away, 
 cause none of us thought it was to 
 the stakes are high, the water's rough 
 but this love is ours 
 
 so weâ€™ve been outnumbered 
 raided and a love the sky 
 and you don't know, what you don't know... 
 
 oh oh 
 oh, it's not sorry 
 no, no, no
