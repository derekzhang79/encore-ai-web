 and i have to. 
 
 he looks around the room 
 when you think tim mcgraw 
 i hope you think my favorite song 
 and i go back to december all the time 
 
 i just see me from you 
 i didn't mean for you to " 
 and you made me believe 
 
 and talking turned to screams. 
 
 i need you to need me 
 need me,tell me 
 (baby) 
 that sunset gleamin 
 as my daddy said, stay away now, 
 i’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door 
 don’t wait or my daddy said, stay around now, i'm haunted 
 
 stood there and so long 
 should have fit like a ring 
 like a sunset had you all around 
 the time is gonna come when you're so mad you wanted 
 how if it's just so much 
 and all the people that we meet 
 as we go 
 but the very next day, you gave it away 
 this year, to save you now 
 oh, whoa, oh, oh 
 uh, oh, oh
