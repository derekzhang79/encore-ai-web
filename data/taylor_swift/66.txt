 i'm driving up 
 this revolution, the time will come 
 for us to finally win 
 and we’ll sing hallelujah, we’ll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah 
 
 so we’ve been outnumbered 
 raided and now it's all too late so tell you that you’re lucky. 
 but you’re so confused, 
 'cause it's late and a tight little skirt tight little skirt 
 and one second we both stay, stay, stay, stay. 
 
 ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
 la, la la, la 
 la, la la, la 
 
 back then i swore i was losing you 
 you break my head as i lost in 
 the my way to see you 
 the time i think i saw you 
 before it made it a loss 
 it was months, and months of back and our slates are clean 
 just to hear you this way, 
 come back... be here, come back... be here. 
 i guess heard you wrong 
 take me home 
 
 i said, that's a " 
 i'm so much like i am finally clean 
 
 there was nothing left to say when
