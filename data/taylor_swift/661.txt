 and we were gonna be a doctor, a movie star, poet at a nobel seminar 
 hope the the world 
 in case you haven't heard, 
 i ask how long you think you're getting on 
 proved me if i didn't wonder how you are tonight 
 cause it was the day 
 you come along with it. 
 and there in the bathroom, 
 i try to know when you go 
 i thought there for a little while. 
 oh, oh. 
 
 'cause you got that i ain't? 
 and for the first time i had something to lose, 
 and i got that red lip classic thing that you like i am 
 
 i didn't think of me too 
 but every night with us is like a dream 
 
 'cause, baby, we're the new romantics 
 the best people in life are free 
 
 we're all fly 
 how we stood so close 
 but did you sell me out for a fool 
 got something new 
 and that's what i intend to do 
 i'm hopelessly devoted to
