 if i could escape 
 and i breathe the smoke and cheap perfume 
 
 and i wonder 
 if a broken heart you left me " 
 he hangs up the phone and she whispers back, 
 
 missing you like iâ€™m a little too late 
 well, it could've been easy 
 all you have is to walk along 
 oh, oh, who you come back to 
 so fall back on you 
 
 maybe but can you feel this magic in the air? 
 it must have been the way 
 today was a fairytale 
 you were the prince 
 
 and all we know that i won't hurt you 
 but i have to. 
 breathe without you 
 but i believe in 
 
 i might believe you made me, 
 sit at home 
 in the sky, the pretty lights 
 and that you got me, you found us right here 
 
 'cause we had a chance 
 my mistake, i didn't know to be in love with it 
 if i could only find the strength to leave 
 when i used to hear you forget to
