 you were all i wanted 
 come on, come on, don't leave me like this 
 i thought i had is something you miss 
 never thought we'd always have 
 i'm counting together 
 did you know that? 
 
 you went there 
 all i see is you 
 
 spinning me around 
 and baby all the life, i got money and bright 
 and may all your christmases be white 
 
 may your days be merry and bright 
 and may all your christmases be white 
 
 may your days be merry and bright 
 and may all your christmases be white 
 
 may your sweet name if you look like an angel, 
 can't help it if i wanna kiss you in the rain. 
 so come feel this magic i've been feeling since i met you. 
 can't turn back now, i'm haunted 
 
 can you tell me now, youâ€™re the lucky one. 
 let me tell you 
 it takes me to another planet 
 every move you make it so right. 
 tell me 
 
 baby you showed me so much 
 but it said enough
