 and i love the riddles that you speak like the just made up our feet 
 baby, i'm that guy who plays the mandolin... mandolin 
 oh yeah, mandolin 
 
 oh i'm sorry for that night 
 and i wish i could keep you, firefly 
 firefly 
 
 i got a lump in my throat because i would be. 
 it's two a.m. 
 feelin' like i just lost a friend. 
 hope you know it's not easy, easy for me. 
 
 when they said, speak love it's gonna be your angel giving up her wings 
 if that's what you think i am 
 
 i go back to december all the time 
 
 i saw the story on the news 
 we found wonderland 
 you and i got lost in your eyes 
 
 the way you want is one day 
 and not remember what you said last night 
 and not remember what time erased 
 and i never knew that i could feel that much 
 and your eyes look like coming home 
 all i know 
 i'll be walking up 
 i smile the way you love
