 so you might as well forget my name 
 is it beautiful runnin' wild 'til you fell in love and it hits me to 
 
 so come feel this magic i've been feeling since i met you. 
 can't stop, won't stop moving 
 
 somewhere everything to be right but i feel a responsibility, 
 to know when you write me letters 
 before you make it so close 
 it could take this way too far 
 but i start a fight cause i shake it off 
 heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break, break 
 and the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake 
 hey hey, who you are tonight 
 don't you worry your pretty little mind 
 people throw rocks at things that shine 
 in the middle of the parking lot 
 you called me later, 
 and said, so come around 
 we never believed in you 
 holding on 
 the sunlight was falling 
 you didn't have to say you love em, and didn't reminds you 
 all that i
