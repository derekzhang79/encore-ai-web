 
 not a little outta reach 
 or the girl on a cover but you tore her 
 and i said remember 
 so they they call you? 
 didn't i’ll drive on 
 the days drag me 
 as the sweet 
 wind dances 
 i'll write a run 
 
 bye, bye, baby 
 i like my windows down 
 so i don't think i thought that i would be. 
 it's an exit sign 
 i was barely breathing a light 
 can't turn back now, it's all good. 
 i wish you would 
 i wish you would 
 
 it's not like i wanted to 
 but every night with us is like a dream 
 
 baby, i'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake 
 i shake it off, 
 i, i, i, i shake it off 
 it's so much more 
 i'd run to 
 i was a dreamer before you went and let me down, 
 now it's not be anything like, anything like 
 that you see what you're doing to me 
 tell me,oh 
 you’ll never leave me
