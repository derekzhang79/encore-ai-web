 take this chance, i'll make you mine 
 
 like shadows in a faded light 
 i just wanna show you 
 she don’t even know you, 
 she's ferocious 
 and she knows just what it takes to make it feel right. 
 and i hope you know that every time i don't 
 i almost didn't notice 
 all i know is we said, "hello." 
 and your eyes look like coming home 
 all i know since yesterday is everything has changed 
 
 [ed sheeran] 
 and all the people that we meet 
 we can try to hide my tears. 
 the secrets or my deepest fears. 
 through it all nobody gets me like you do. 
 and you got your share of secrets 
 and only a while i thought that i miss you too much about 
 all you had to do was stay 
 all you had to do things like the time i saw your face, i'd be 
 over you his favorite color's green 
 he loves to argue, born on the seventeenth 
 his sister's beautiful, he has his father’s eyes
