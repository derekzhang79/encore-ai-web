 and i could know that you see is someone i don't know 
 i wasnâ€™t brought up that way 
 
 but love's got me cornered in the back of the room 
 i'm spinning around, i'm spinning around 
 and all i can think to do is let me down, 
 now it's not easy, easy for me. 
 
 the sun goes down on a good times, you and i are a story 
 that never gets told 
 if what you are that i ain't your competition 
 think i'm a little more brave 
 it's my turn to be me 
 
 it's here we are the way 
 today was a fairytale 
 
 time slows down 
 whenever you're around 
 and all i see is you 
 but, baby, can't you see 
 you belong with me, 
 you belong with me. 
 
 cause, every single time i come on this show 
 it's really weird 
 really weird 
 always been getting back together 
 
 like, ever... 
 
 well i'll be waiting at the front gate 
 that's
