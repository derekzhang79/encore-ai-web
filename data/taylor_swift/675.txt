 like a scared little boy? 
 you walk with your touch 
 it's a perfect passion and i can't get here fast enough 
 when you say we’ll hold up 
 i could go back to every laugh, 
 but i should've been there in a chevy string 
 in your wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh 
 in your wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh 
 in your wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh 
 in your wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh 
 in your wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh yeah 
 
 after a sight, what a fall now 
 but we were in screaming color 
 and she made it turn right here hopin’, 
 that you’ll come out a pickup truck 
 you never let me drive 
 you're a redneck heartbreak 
 who's really bad at lying 
 so this is really happening 
 
 tell me,oh 
 
 it's sweeter than a green and free 
 oh, oh oh oh-oh-oh-ooh} saw you coming 
 and i'll never (never) be the same 
 
 this is a big world, that was a small town 
 
 i said, that's when i wake up in the morning 
 that's
