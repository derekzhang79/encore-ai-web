 now that's a close time 
 cause i'm not trying to show maturity 
 
 "x" is the shape i drew through your face 
 in permanent marker 
 oh, yeah 
 just like all those bright you're right for you 
 and i hear the words my daddy said things like a green light 
 
 you said 
 
 i'm you're feeling so flying 
 and that's what i intend to do 
 don't count the days as they leave you 
 it takes five seconds to need you, 
 when they were gonna buy someday 
 and we both cried 
 
 'cause i get a little crazy 
 when i jumped in, 
 is ain't your territory, 
 we had the only up when you're not down. 
 don't wanna be 
 well, there's gotta be more 
 there's gotta be more 
 'cause i'm gunna see my daddy drive out 
 you come to my last breath 
 
 tell her how you held me is that i know is we said, "hello." 
 and your first kiss makes your head 
 he caught me staring at him
