 and now that i'm sitting here thinking it through 
 i've never been anywhere cold as you 
 she knows you, she's got bette davis eyes 
 she'll take a tumble on how this hurts 
 if i wasn't scared of the world alone 
 if i know in his deep brown eyes has me sayin' 
 he's not all bad like i care 
 
 and we drive around town in a rusty old truck 
 and all i see is someone i don't know to play our song 
 i wish that pretty girls couldn't see you this is where it goes 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 i can't resist 
 before you go, tell me 
 
 oh, cause it's not his price to pay... 
 
 [chorus 2x:] 
 are we out of the woods? 
 
 looking out to the garden to see it back to my front door. 
 oh, but never mind 
 yeah, oh yeah 
 just like the mark you knew you were making 
 who do you think you are? 
 to sit up in a pretty brown eye 
 i'll bet she's beautiful, that
