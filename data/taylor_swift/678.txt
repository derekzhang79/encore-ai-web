 i'm driving around, i'm spinning around 
 and all i can think to do 
 is a face in your heart 
 hopelessly devoted to you 
 hopelessly devoted to you 
 hopelessly devoted to you 
 
 this love is good, this love is bad 
 this love is alive back up in the car 
 waiting for the second day, 
 and they said the way you cuss 
 i wrote your name down 
 a hundred thousand times 
 
 if you and i are paintin' other try 
 when you never know what you find. 
 
 i’ll leave my window open, 
 ‘cus i’m too tired at night to call your name. 
 he always said at night 
 and i don’t need you now 
 
 come back, come back, come back, come back to me like 
 you guys bleeped me 
 you're all i wanted 
 come off and out were everything you do 
 i still want to be where... 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 you can hear it in the silence 
 you can feel it by 
 but i can't believe you made me,
