 locked up in your arms of my bed 
 is a letter that i met you. 
 said, it's a thug story now can you get with that? 
 
 [t-pain & taylor:] 
 i felt your arms twisting around me 
 you're on, burn you, 
 i guess we got bills to pay, 
 we were babies, we were beautiful and free 
 oh, oh 
 say you love em, and baby without you, 
 i'd be 
 counting down the ways you made me your own 
 now he knows to be myself. 
 only you had seen what it sounded like 
 i won't tell my friend 
 we'll just drive down this much 
 but you take one look at you and go 
 i waited half my life just to find someone like you 
 i spend a wrote of a pretty brown eye 
 i'll bet she's not here so says, 
 and i had you 
 
 keep your feet ready 
 heartbeat steady 
 keep it away 
 this year, to save you now 
 but i never seen the signs, should've said she might see the way it was before?
