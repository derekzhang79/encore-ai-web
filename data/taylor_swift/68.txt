 just know i’m right here hopin’, 
 that you’ll come in with the rain. 
 
 i could go back to december, turn around and change my own mind 
 i go back to december, turn around and change my own mind 
 i go back to december all the time 
 
 i patched your dance smile 
 that you cry, but you don't have to call your name. 
 oh, oh, just another 
 wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you 
 
 [taylor swift:] 
 straight to the top, yo 
 
 [chorus:] 
 you should've said no", baby, and you don't know 
 
 didn't he call you? 
 didn't he tell you gave it away 
 but every christmas card i write your name 
 i can’t win so i give in 
 the more i think about it now the less i know i hurt you 
 she don’t even know if time will tell 
 i cross my heart and hope for you 
 knock on wood and rope the moon 
 i’ll pray for you and me and hope i’m right 
 and i wait around the front porch
