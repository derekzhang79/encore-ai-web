 pick out your name with our changing minds 
 that wasn't how it was supposed to be with me and you 
 and the story of how we both forever but i stay at home 
 still thinking we're together 
 i know places 
 
 they say you got my distance in the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs 
 i love it when they're touching mine 
 your hands make the crisps at the cradle 
 to tell me why one thing was ever new back 
 and in a car, getting nearer 
 she doesn't see your beauty 
 is the face in the mirror looking at you like the stars 
 and talk to someone i don't know why but with you i'd dance in a storm in 
 you tell me that you wanna be with me too 
 so i'mma stay through the name 
 
 so here's to everything coming down to nothing 
 and all you got are your shattered hopes 
 they never saw me for a second you would call 
 and i can teach you bad, bad things 
 ooh, ooh, love's like this 
 it's something i missed
