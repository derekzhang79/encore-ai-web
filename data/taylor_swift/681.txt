 it's miserable and magical. 
 oh, yeah 
 just like the mark you knew you were making 
 who do you think you are? 
 to write on fast not all alone 
 forgetting him was like wishing the sweet breeze swept you away but 
 never looking down. 
 and every time you're here 
 but i do, i do, i know, 
 someday i'll be living in a big ole city 
 and all the young things line up to take your place. 
 
 so i'll just one more thing to do 
 can you tell me now, youâ€™re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh. 
 
 come back, come back, come back to me like 
 you would, you would if i could be your favorite blue jeans 
 with his car 
 and i had you 
 
 the water filled my lungs, i screamed so loud but no one heard just a song that moves along 
 we won't be shattered on the first kiss 
 you could see you remember 
 today is never too late to be brand new 
 
 it's alright, just wait for the day
