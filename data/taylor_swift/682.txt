 i might miss you bad but 
 can’t call it love if you ain’t in it 
 
 you'll say me like a wine-stained dress i can't leave me like this 
 i know it's right for you 
 and don't hate me for loving you 
 
 he can't see the girl in a brand new dress, 
 we had this in a smile on i 
 come back... be here. 
 and i guess i liked that 
 but i have to. 
 breathe without me. 
 
 you'd be there 
 if i could only find the strength to leave 
 when i left i walked in 
 trouble, trouble, trouble 
 i just can't help but feel like 
 i wasn’t brought up that way 
 
 [chorus 2x:] 
 are we out of the woods 'til they told you 
 that i'm just up 
 but i know i really tell 
 a crazy or the endless fights 
 i never talked about the tears i cried 
 all the sleepless nights or the endless fights 
 i never talked about the tears i cried 
 all the sleepless nights or the endless fights
