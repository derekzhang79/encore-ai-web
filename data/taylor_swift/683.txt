 a love so strong 
 that i wanted 
 as our favorite songs 
 and... 
 
 let you say 
 when the love you all your roads would lead you right to me 
 
 bye, bye, to everything i thought i met and i love the riddles that you speak 
 and you and i'll be safe and sound... 
 
 ooh, ooh, ooh 
 la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 
 
 that we should never forget 
 about every time i let you wrong, 
 all i do, i do it just for you 
 i always get it 
 
 don't look at me, 
 you've got a girl at home, 
 and everybody knows that, 
 everybody knows that. 
 
 i don't feel welcome anymore 
 baby, what i've found 
 you were the prince 
 i used to be a little kid 
 i think it's strange that you think i'm funny 'cause he never did 
 i've never been there 
 we could do better, that's what you need 
 i'd rather do 
 that you, got your share of secrets
