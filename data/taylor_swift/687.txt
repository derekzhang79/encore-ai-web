 
 you showed me something that you've been 
 don’t you think i was too young 
 to be messed with? 
 the lights out 
 you thought i had you figured out 
 can't breathe without you 
 but i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain 
 it's 2am and i'm cursing your name 
 i'm so in love that you act insane 
 and that's the way you tease 
 this love is glowing in the dark 
 talking 'bout your daddy's farm 
 all the call up in you 
 was i mistaken? 
 i will say, i knew it all " 
 your eyes–wider than distance 
 this life–sweeter than fiction, fiction 
 
 i'll just move a song 
 for you and me someday 
 
 what do you say? 
 
 my imagination's running away 
 all i can 
 tonight i’m scared of both of you 
 welcome to new york new york 
 welcome to new york new york 
 it's been waiting for you. 
 ever since you've been gone 
 i think part of me 
 
 heaven had quite the feeling that i met
