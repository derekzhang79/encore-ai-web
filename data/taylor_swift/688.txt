 but they never blind me, me 
 welcome to new york new york 
 new soundtrack 
 it's been waiting for you 
 welcome to new york 
 welcome to new york 
 
 it's a new soundtrack 
 i could dance to this beat 
 the lights and noise are blinding 
 we hang back, it's all in my perfect weather 
 to save me. 
 
 this morning will be your little beauty queen 
 but i can't believe 
 that you were not here at all? 
 
 i was there in your way 
 your precious heart 
 broken and scarred 
 somehow you made up the phone with your guitar man 
 your shining boots and your full on band 
 a smile 
 that could light up the sky 
 and i can't trust anything now 
 and it's not feeling anything to see it through 
 
 because of ellen 
 
 every single time i come on this show 
 it's really weird 
 really weird 
 always end up dancing 
 
 i've been spending the last eight months 
 
 who you are that i ain't
