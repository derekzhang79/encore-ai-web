 just one more thing to 
 
 'cause i hate my friends 
 said keep all a light up name on the radio 
 
 so dim that spotlight, tell me things like 
 i can feel you like a perfect storm 
 
 rain came pouring down 
 you can love like a sinner and lose like a winner 
 nothing's shatterproof 
 you can crash and burn and come back someone new 
 and that's the way i loved you 
 breaking down and coming undone 
 it's a roller coaster kinda rush 
 and i never (never) {[x8:] oh oh, oh, oh i just wanna live without you. 
 
 [chorus:] 
 just a little outta reach 
 or the girl living next door 
 tell me 
 you’ll always need the game 
 
 she's not a saint 
 and she's got her hopes up 
 got 'em up to there 
 wondering what to wear 
 
 the way you look, the way you laugh, 
 the way you love with all you have, 
 i’ll meet you, lucky you 
 
 you got that you walk with your hands 
 
 and all
