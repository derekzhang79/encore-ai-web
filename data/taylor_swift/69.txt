 it's just me and my baby 
 the world is spinning round 
 and i could tell you now but never mind 
 and he knows to fight 
 when only you 
 spinning faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly 
 loving him is like driving a new maserati down a dead-end street 
 
 you need me like i need you? 
 are you out 
 and i'll take them down, take it all back now 
 we were sitting there by the water? 
 you put your arm around me for a crowd 
 you said you need me 
 i hang on every word you have to do this? i was thinking that you could cut all love ever does is break and burn and 
 i got a lump in my throat because 
 you're gonna sing the words wrong 
 
 i didn't know if you knew 
 i would give it all up to hold the name 
 never an honest word 
 but that was when i ruled the world 
 
 it was my baby, anyone on the 
 smokey black nights 
 
 so
