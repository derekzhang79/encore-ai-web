 lightning and thunder 
 we tried in vain 
 to hold you 
 but why they say i’ve always known 
 what i wanted you to chase after me 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 this love is glowing in the dark 
 these hands had to let me in 
 shattered is faded heart 
 though you come to my door 
 i'd be breaking all my rules 
 i used to be a damsel in distress 
 you took my place 
 and you're tired of another 
 wind dances 
 i'll make one 
 i found from just you 
 and in the middle of the parking lot 
 yeah 
 
 and so it goes 
 you can hear it in the silence 
 you can feel it by the way 
 
 i saw the footage from the roof 
 i sat down on the front porch 
 talking about love and how it changes things that you wish it was me, 
 you 
 i guess you’re the best night, never would forget how he moved 
 the words that you look like coming home 
 all i see is you
