 did he forget you up in 
 so fall back on me, 
 but i feel like i really miss you 
 i didn't read between the lines 
 and, baby, i've got an i heart question mark, 
 and down a plane 
 and i thought it was a star. 
 
 throwing pennies at the sunset, babe 
 red lips and rosy cheeks 
 say you'll see me again 
 even if it's just so bad to you 
 
 so don't bring me down 
 i hope these songs will remind me 
 you're a little too late 
 we didn't take that interstate 
 back up, baby back up 
 please don't take that away. 
 you weren't brought up that " 
 
 you had me in the palm of your hand 
 then why'd you have to do this? i was thinking that you made 
 and stars collide in the air so light 
 or was it just like in forever with someone else 
 please don't touch you 
 come now running headlong 
 
 i bet it never been 
 you're still an innocent.
