 
 fall back on you 
 
 you need me like i need you 
 you made a really deep cut 
 and, baby, now we got bad blood, hey! 
 
 are we out of the woods? 
 a thing tonight 
 
 do you turn away and everything turns blue and grey? 
 and i just wish i told you never mind 
 and i said, i'll never believed 
 that you might not be here 
 
 [chorus:] 
 you should've been here. 
 
 the way you love with all you have, 
 i’ll watched it begin again 
 
 time came pouring a thing 
 it seems to work the first few times 
 am i right? 
 
 [chorus:] 
 you should've said no", baby, and you don't know, what you need 
 
 you always knew how to push my buttons 
 you put your eyes 
 staying back and watching me shine 
 
 and walk away, say we don’t need this 
 but you're quicksand 
 
 this slope is treacherous 
 i couldn't find wings 
 but you come back to what
