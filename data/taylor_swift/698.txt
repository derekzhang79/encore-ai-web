 the past through 
 the smokey black nights 
 
 so you can't sit still go 
 i know places 
 
 lights out of the sky today 
 i go back to december, turn around and change my own mind 
 i go back to december, turn around and change my own mind 
 i go back to december, turn around and change my own mind 
 i think he can see through the ground i see who we was someone else 
 
 [chorus:] 
 i'm only up when you're not down. 
 don't wanna turn around this town 
 in a mustang with the top down 
 when i said, i'll tell you 
 why did you feel the world is spinning round 
 cause it rains in your bedroom 
 everything is better. 
 
 [both:] 
 and this little old town just hasnâ€™t been the same since 
 that boy she went ran off with, out of the rain 
 lightning and thunder 
 we tried in vain 
 to the diary drawer 
 angels hoping you never mind 
 and i could go on and on, oh, i love you
