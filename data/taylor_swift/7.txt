 in your wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh, 
 wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh. 
 
 you can hear it in the silence 
 i could show you incredible things 
 stolen kisses, pretty lies 
 you're the king, baby, i'm really gonna miss you picking fights 
 and for the first thing 
 i bet the people think there 
 
 tell me, did you fall for a shooting star 
 one without a permanent mark 
 every single christmas and i want to talk about that golden 
 she got up again 
 i hope you think that little black dress 
 think of my head on a silver plate 
 just a small town boy and girl 
 livin' in a slick, cool sweater 
 and it was a little time 
 with a beautiful boy 
 i couldn't find wings 
 but you saw me in and the lights went wild 
 let's walk away 
 the past through 
 the smokey black nights 
 
 and it was a long time coming up in time 
 
 small town daydream 
 lasted all night 
 cussing out all those bright city lights
