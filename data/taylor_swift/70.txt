 gonna climb the mountain 
 and been trampled on 
 and say you want me, 
 you've got a girl at home, 
 and everybody knows that, 
 uh, uh 
 don't look at me, 
 you've got a girl at home, 
 and everybody knows that, 
 everybody knows that, 
 uh, uh 
 don't look at me, 
 you've got a lot to say between now and forever 
 but no one notices until it's too 
 late to look with me 
 a perfect little dream inside my head, 
 and then you walk right by, i'm screaming out inside 
 why you gotta be so?... 
 i just lost a friend. 
 hope you know it's not easy, easy for me. 
 
 and i just wanna tell you this ain't the dark smile and the fun i've missed 
 think i was there, never scared 
 
 don't you look in my eyes 
 i might fall in love 
 with 'em in a straight line 
 you can't get here as soon as hell 
 
 i never miss a fight unresolved. 
 his walls that they they look at me 
 heaven
