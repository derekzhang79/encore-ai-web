 
 heaven had quite the time is running here 
 deep you're sinking, 
 round yon virgin mother and child 
 holy infant so tender and mild 
 sleep in heavenly peace 
 
 silent night, holy night 
 all is calm and all the things that we wished they would always do? 
 what if i say 
 by the way 
 
 all my friends are saying 
 girl, what we are 
 and you were there 
 
 and all the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind once you saw you just what you are forever 
 and i will hurt you now 
 come morning light 
 you got me, you do 
 
 don't be afraid to 
 jump then fall 
 
 i just drive on by, drive on, drive on 
 drive all there's all these fun 
 his feet hey baby i would go back, i'm haunted 
 
 i don't wanna miss you like this. 
 come back... be here. 
 i haven't been there 
 
 when we said forever and always 
 
 whoa, oh, oh
