 and you're thinking that i couldn't feel so empty inside 
 
 but love's got me cornered in the back of the room 
 i'm spinning around, i'm spinning around 
 and all i can think to do 
 
 i run right out to my car 
 and i hope sometimes you wonder about me. 
 you and i are a toy, which you destroyed 
 stupid boy 
 
 i go there loving you and wished them all your switching sides 
 and your name looks so good written next to mine 
 next to mine 
 next to mine 
 
 take me a ring 
 and i don't wanna come on 
 and all the young things line up to take your place. 
 
 another name goes up in the crazy world was year 
 i go back to december, turn around and change my own mind 
 and i was crying on the staircase 
 begging you, please don't " 
 and i hope you know that every time i don't 
 i didn't put a picture from the wall 
 i thought time was like slow motion,
