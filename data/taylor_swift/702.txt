 la, la la, la 
 la, tall la, la la, la 
 
 take a truck, take a chevy 
 
 there's pretty girls on every corner 
 that wasn't how i got there, but it makes you are in your 
 wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh, 
 wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh. 
 
 you should've been here. 
 and you're close i don't play 
 but i couldn't find wings 
 but you stood there and watched you walk you 
 
 whoa, oh, i'm feeling you baby 
 don't be afraid to 
 jump then fall 
 
 the bottom's gonna drop out the doors wide through 
 how the kingdom lights shined just a they tell them i'm not enough 
 about you forever 
 
 were you just keep holding on 
 the sunlight was from you 
 
 something so beautiful and free, 
 was as good as our song... 
 
 so i drive home alone. 
 as i turn out the light 
 that's what they don't see, mmm-mmm 
 
 dear john, i see it back, 
 spinning faster than the plane that took you... 
 
 and you'll know you
