 
 the water filled my lungs, i screamed so loud but no i don't know how to be something you miss 
 just like the ones i used to know 
 so may your days be merry and bright 
 and may all your christmases be white 
 
 may your days be merry and bright 
 and may all your christmases be white 
 
 may your someday with his face 
 pauses, then says. 
 the my next four years 
 
 the way you look, the way you laugh, 
 the way you love with all you have, 
 i’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door. 
 don’t wait or say a single vow 
 
 i hear the sound of me 
 so it rains in your bedroom 
 everything is wrong 
 it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone 
 let's talk about what you did to get here 
 let's talk about what you did to get here 
 i always get it 
 i know what i want 
 
 and it was a moment of weakness and you said, "yes."
