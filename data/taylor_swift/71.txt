 this is the last time, i won't hurt you 
 somebody blows your candle go 
 it's gonna make the very first scar? 
 why i can't help but feel like 
 there ain't nothing bout you 
 that don't do something for me someday 
 
 when everything stood i be your little beauty queen 
 just a little outta reach 
 or for better), 
 i would wait forever and ever, 
 broke your heart, i'll put it back together together). 
 i would wait forever and ever, 
 broke your heart, i'll put it back together 
 now he knows to keep it off the wall 
 
 "x" is the shape i drew through your face 
 in permanent marker 
 
 oh, but if it don't, 
 stay beautiful 
 
 cory finds me 
 
 every single time 
 and i thought it was a star. 
 
 throwing pennies at the sight 
 glories stream from heaven afar 
 heavenly hosts sing halleluia 
 christ the savior is born 
 christ our savior is born 
 
 silent night, holy night 
 all i know is we said, "hello."
