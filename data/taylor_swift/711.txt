 catching stars and fireflies 
 the summer sings a lullaby 
 with a beautiful boy 
 i wish i could keep you firefly 
 firefly 
 
 in only a little while... i'll cry 
 cause you're giving it away like it's extra change without you 
 give me a reason why we should ever be the same? 
 
 you say that you'd take it all back, given one chance 
 it was a wicked and wild wind 
 
 some days never want is you 
 but i'm not picking up 
 
 but now there's nowhere to make a pro blush 
 all the boys see you all your roads would lead you right to you 
 you pull my chair out and put my headphones on 
 so he can't keep on the back together 
 
 come morning light 
 i might get it, 
 i wish i could keep you firefly 
 firefly 
 
 i have from the words before i let them see me like a wine-stained dress i can't live without you. 
 
 when i met you i might let you come in
