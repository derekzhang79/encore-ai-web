 but on a wednesday in a cafe i watched it begin again 
 
 cold barn struck bed, everything you used to be a story 
 who had as many james taylor records as you

 and that small town in 
 you can call me t-sweezy 
 now i'm a rap star

 shorty i'm a take ya 
 
 [taylor swift t-pain):] 
 what, what, i knit sweaters, yo! 
 what, what, don't test me (beep) 
 hey, hold up to your door,

 let you go baby 
 now that i see you turn off your phone, 
 and i almost brought up something
