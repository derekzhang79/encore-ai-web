 
 but i don’t know 
 where i lost control 
 and couldn’t take it any longer 
 remember the footsteps, remember the words you whispered to me 
 they say you're not sorry 
 no, no, no 
 you're not sorry 
 or it's gonna go out 
 and you might as well forget my name 
 
 i never been on a plane 
 my days once revolved around 
 if you check off 
 i don't wanna miss you like this. 
 come back... be here. 
 i always knew this time would come 
 when i ask how long you wrong 
 and i did the story line ends 
 it should have all worked out 
 but it didn't 
 
 [repeat chorus] 
 
 you got me alone 
 you got the keys to get with that? 
 
 [taylor swift:] 
 straight to the top, yo 
 
 [t-pain:] 
 watching all my voice 
 just two kids making up for lost love 
 
 all the other kids with the pumped up kicks 
 you better hold from the wall 
 i haven't been sleeping 
 staying up, playing back myself
