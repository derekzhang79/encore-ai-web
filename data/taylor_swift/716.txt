 everything i need is right 
 i had to listen to my mumma's i told you " 
 you ain't never been through that 
 we are never getting back together 
 you go come a way 
 
 look at you now, like the stars that shined 
 in the sky, as your humiliation 
 you have knocked me off the phone 
 you, let me say 
 
 do you remember, when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you 
 ooh, ooh 
 la, la la, la 
 
 just close your eyes 
 the sun is going down 
 we could be just as good 
 if you check off my of the things you told her 
 
 so you come away with a great little story 
 of a mess of a dreamer with the crumbs she throws you 
 she's ferocious 
 and she knows just what it takes to make a pro blush 
 she got up again 
 you got me like a promise. 
 so baby, make it last all night 
 she was an american girl 
 
 oh yeah, all right 
 take this chance,
