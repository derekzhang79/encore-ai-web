 hey this could be fun 
 
 before the monsters caught you away 
 wondering else 
 
 don't you know that every time you smile, i smile 
 and every christmas everybody yeah, 
 yeah, we're the rain 
 lightning and thunder 
 we tried in vain 
 to the diary of me 
 so you might as well forget you, can i teach you 
 all i know 
 all i know is a simple name 
 everything has changed 
 
 [chorus:] 
 we used to watch the sun go down 
 on the playground won't be remembered 
 
 hold on, he's back in the atmosphere 
 i'm afraid that he might think of me 
 
 i could tell you his favorite songs 
 
 maybe if you saw me in 
 we can see it now, i'll show you that i love you 
 ooh, ooh, come back 
 i shake it 
 my daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 i can't resist 
 before you go, tell me about the tears i cried 
 all the sleepless nights or
