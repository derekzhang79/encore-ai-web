 begging you, please don't know 
 but we were happy 
 
 when it was hard to take, 
 yes, yes, this changes keeps you 
 you are in love, true love 
 you're in love 
 
 you can you come back to 
 so shame on me now 
 find things they never wish i could keep you firefly 
 firefly 
 
 we're dead 
 but your long kiss 
 it's like a million little stars 
 memories like photographs 
 oh baby,here we are 
 
 tell me 
 you’ll never leave me 
 and i’m not perfect you could say 
 
 wish it can't be we're already through 
 did you sell me out for a fool 
 after you held me is that just what you do 
 what did you need from me 
 tell me how to ruin someone's perfect day 
 that july 9th 
 the beat of your heart 
 feel the warmth 
 on my face 
 when i saw you standing there 
 it must have been the way 
 
 but here in this perfect weather 
 it's like we don't remember
