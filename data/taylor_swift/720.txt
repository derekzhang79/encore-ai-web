 and the camera flashes, make me stay 
 and all i really wanna do is be next to you 
 you don't know about me 
 my love come in a bowl of fire? 
 will it be filled with hope and desire? 
 will my love come in a pouring rain? 
 am i ready for the joy, am i ready for the boy, am i ready for the boy, am i ready for the boy, am you 
 and now i didn't bring her here 
 so you can hear it in the silence 
 you can see this feeling 
 and i could tell you now but never gets 
 i want to be everything you need 
 i want to be where... 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 burn, burn, burn, baby, burn and waiting for me 
 
 time slows down 
 whenever you're around 
 and lost your string 
 and he brought up her first ray of me and plain girls 
 
 [chorus:] 
 that i'm sorry for that " 
 and i just think you should, think you should know 
 that nothing safe is worth remember what time erased
