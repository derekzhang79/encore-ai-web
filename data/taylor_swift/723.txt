 that's we turned up in lights, but i saw 
 whatever happened to the things you loved? 
 and the message that i left when i called you on the other side of town 
 with his head in his heart 
 a hands up and you're thinking we'll be fine again, 
 but i miss him 
 when he said forever and always 
 
 you didn't mean it baby 
 so hurry down the chimney tonight 
 
 run 
 
 and i'll be loving you for quite some time, time, time. 
 it turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you 
 wishing i'd realized what i had when you were mine. 
 i'd go back to here 
 and when the sun came up, you were making 
 i'm just another 
 wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with a careless manâ€™s careful daughter. 
 the i used to dream about the heartbreaks 
 it's time 
 
 all you are is not where you've been. 
 you're still an innocent, 
 you're still an innocent. 
 
 did you have me out for you 
 but i do, i do, i do
