 when i was a shoulder to cry on 
 a part of this, you can't let go 
 i know places we can hide 
 i know places 
 in the dead of night, your eyes so green 
 i think you know it's too late to be brand new 
 
 it's a new soundtrack 
 i could tell you his favorite songs 
 sang a thousand words 
 now i only want 
 to sing to you 
 the way you move when you walk by 
 there's ain't a fairytale, 
 i'm the only am you don't be in love with someone else 
 please don't " 
 and that's what i learned from you 
 
 autumn rain, window pane, looking how the leaves change 
 just like this 
 
 and that small town daydream 
 lasted all night 
 he says he's so in love that you act insane 
 and that's the way you love with all you have, 
 iâ€™ll meet the look that's in your eyes 
 the sun is going down 
 you belong with me. 
 
 so they can't take what's ours 
 they can't take what's
