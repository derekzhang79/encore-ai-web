 
 i just get down yeah 
 
 but every night with us is like a dream from the bad from the wall 
 i always knew this time would come 
 when i ask how long you think you're gonna be " 
 you see me in hindsight 
 tangled up with you all the time. 
 it turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you 
 wishing i'd realized that i couldn't 
 i will miss you bad but 
 can’t call it love if you ain’t in it
