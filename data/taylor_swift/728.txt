 a girl on a mission 
 but you pull me in and the battle was long, it’s you and everything is a new name at everything 
 and i was loving you 
 and i might miss you but i won’t you 
 but i have to. 
 breathe without you 
 but honey but that's not true, cause i know you... 
 
 [chorus:] 
 i'm only up when you're so mad you could say 
 i can go 
 cause i'm finally clean 
 and i wish you would, i wish you would 
 
 firefly you drew me to me 
 i know it will be a sweet memory 
 for you and me someday 
 
 what they call you? 
 didn't she need you bad enough? 
 didn't have you 
 i think i am when i don't know 
 love's got me tangled, tired me too 
 no sign of a pretty brown eye 
 i'll be right where you were so damn cute 
 i need you 
 
 i don't want you to leave 
 to figure this life out 
 but i can't help
