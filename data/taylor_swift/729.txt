 the days drag on 
 stupid girl, 
 i should have known it all this time 
 but i do 
 turn the lock and put my headphones on 
 the days drag on 
 stupid girl, 
 i was a dreamer before you went and let me know that every time i look at you, it’s like i’m melting on into you 
 give me a light 
 
 i know you can't see me like that it's not fair that you're not around 
 'cause i never seen it before 
 i wanna show you 
 all i know, 
 someday you will... 
 
 wake up and find 
 
 you said forever and always 
 
 oh, and it was a long time coming 
 i waited half my life just to find someone like you 
 i spent a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out 
 not pretty brown eye 
 and it's just another picture to know 
 so may all your christmases be white 
 
 i'm dreaming of a white christmas 
 just like the ones i used to know 
 where the tree tops
