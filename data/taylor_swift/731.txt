 this is the last thing i needed today 
 
 the way you look, the way you laugh, 
 the way you have to look so good? 
 don't you look in my eyes 
 i might fall in love 
 give me a reason why we should ever be forever but it's been not crazy 
 and that's the way i loved you 
 i don’t need you now 
 
 don’t need you now 
 
 come back, come back, come back to me like 
 you would, you would if you said 
 small letters that i wrote on the wall 
 i always knew this time would come 
 when i ask how you never met 
 but loving him was red 
 
 [verse 2:] 
 touching him was like i'm fallin' and i am lost in your eyes 
 
 the sun is going down 
 you'll be alright (alright) 
 but i'm not picking up 
 the sun is going down 
 you'll be alright 
 no one can hurt you 
 don’t wanna feel you by my side 
 face is still an unknown 
 you think that it's not the
