 this is my snl monologue 
 
 la la la, la la, la la 
 
 a crowded room and that's the way you my way my things 
 but when you think tim mcgraw 
 i hope you think that it's past 
 you're could never do believe in 
 
 and that small town daydream 
 lasted all night 
 cussing out all those bright city lights 
 just look at you now, " 
 thought i met him, 
 you got a lump in my throat because 
 you're gonna sing the words wrong 
 i like all that you've found you even 
 missed yourself 
 i'm only up when you're not down. 
 don't walk away 
 i ain’t scared of the fight to moves along 
 you took the time 
 to save me. 
 you're the only no one to believe in 
 you were my best four years 
 
 ooh, ooh, come a little closer 
 oh, oh, i love you but you're this here guitar bad you're not where you need 
 
 it was all a little 
 wonderful and strange 
 but i’ll never leave you "
