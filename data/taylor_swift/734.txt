 welcome to new york 
 a mirror 
 wasn't really in your heart 
 could've sworn you said you loved me 
 when you come back over you to come back 
 that i see you in her arms 
 
 i remind myself you were meant to fly. 
 
 firefly you drew me so close 
 but i know i've been a real bad girl 
 he says, what i do. 
 well you drive me crazy half the time; 
 the other half i'm only trying to let you know that what i feel is true. 
 and i'm only me when i'm there 
 and it started rolling down the street 
 you screamed and ran after it 
 and we pretended it could last forever 
 
 lock me up in a rusty old truck 
 well, that take me home 
 just like the two of us thought it was gonna end that way. 
 people are people, and sometimes we made quite a mess, babe. 
 it's probably better off this way. 
 and i confess, babe, 
 in my dreams so don't you look in my poems
