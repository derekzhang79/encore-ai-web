 through it all again 
 all i know is we said, "hello." 
 and your eyes look like coming home 
 all i could be your angel giving up her wings 
 platinum hiding from you 
 
 it must have been the way 
 
 but by the way 
 if you ever wondered 
 still got the same old number; just in case 
 i asking his car 
 and you had to fight to say 
 but all of this 
 i watched him go 
 he watched me crushed to the floor 
 cried into my bed 
 find me something you miss 
 never thought we'd always have 
 i'm lost in the wind 
 remember when you're home 
 if i drive on, drive on, drive on 
 drive all night, just south of life 
 you say it's not easy, easy for me. 
 
 so this is wrong and my name 
 i never put out for you 
 but for some other old town just hasnâ€™t new like a made up dancing 
 
 disappear when you come back, 
 there's gotta be more 
 there's gotta be more
