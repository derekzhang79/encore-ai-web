 there's nothing else for me to do? 
 i'm just sitting here 
 and talking turned to screams. 
 
 i just wanna live your name 
 i'm so in love that you act insane 
 and that's how it works 
 it's time 
 
 and i know it's true that hear this it's a damn time 
 but i gotta come right through me. 
 but you out clubbing but i just wanna know you know it's been 
 the first date: man, i didn't get my perfect fantasy 
 i realize you love yourself more than you could say "sabotage" 
 
 i see you years from a girl 
 trying to survive 
 
 [chorus:] 
 
 so here's something you should know that was down i'm spinning to the back of my name 
 the summer sings we're the heart and see who wins 
 let's talk about that golden boy that i think " 
 you, i hope you cry getting my r-e-v-e-n-g-e 
 
 so you'll never have to be alone. 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 just as long as you're mine 
 i'll be your everything
