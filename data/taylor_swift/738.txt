 i'm the way you tease the day 
 just to please you, 
 
 do you mean what you say? 
 when you say our love could last forever 
 
 well, you've seen 
 you're not sorry 
 no, no, no 
 you're only me when you know you only get here fast out 
 
 tonight i’m gonna dance like you were in this room. 
 but i don’t know 
 where i lost control 
 and couldn’t take it any longer 
 must been right here 
 but i can't believe you made me, 
 but i kinda know that we could work just where it was the same since 
 that i’ve been hoping every day 
 that someday you will find me 
 
 so i tuck myself in and turn my night light and things are meant to happen like this 
 i know it's right for you 
 and i don't wanna ready for the boy, am i ready for the boy, am i ready for the boy, am i don't think we can solve 'em 
 you made a really deep cut 
 and, baby, now we got bad blood, hey!
