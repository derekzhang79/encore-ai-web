 well, it was kind of cold that lights as i turn a fragile line 
 i have known some things change 
 
 and i know all his favorite songs 
 and... 
 
 [chorus:] 
 he don't look on your face 
 when i said, i'll never let you " 
 when all those shadows went wild 
 tell them how the crowds went wild 
 tell them how i must be the one 
 and you're mortified your mom's dropping you made 
 his beautiful eyes 
 
 there's a shortcut to the highway out of reach 
 
 oh i'm just a girl 
 oh i'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world 
 
 got the radio on, i remember it all too well 
 
 he's so tall and handsome as hell 
 he's so in love, he's finally got it right, 
 
 let me know, how's it feel to be wanted 
 wish you could go back to every laugh, 
 but i don't wanna' go there anymore, 
 and i know you're saying that day 
 had you so far above me? 
 so i'm scared
