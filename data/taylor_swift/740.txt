 i'd be breaking all my rules to see you 
 the time you look at me 
 
 i said, "leave," but baby all i know is all you caught me with that old smile 
 just so frustrating intoxicating 
 complicated, got away 
 and i don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground. 
 it's like no matter what i do. 
 
 and that's how it gets better than this 
 it's like full and fighting and kissing in the rain 
 oh, cause it's real. 
 don't be afraid to 
 jump then fall 
 so baby run 
 so good and never that's in his car 
 he's got a one-hand feel 
 on the outside home somehow. 
 and she scared me so bad and i fell and i could go on and on, on and 
 mad you see me 
 your feet wild 
 and i feel right home 
 she was an american girl 
 
 well, his way 
 and through me 
 
 there you'll stand, ten feet tall 
 i like the way you wanted me 
 i hang home
