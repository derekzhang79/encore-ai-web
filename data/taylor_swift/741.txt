 to an note in his briefcase and drives away 
 to save the breath away 
 oh, i hate you like this in 
 we were lying on a couch 
 the moment i saw you 
 with your hair ainâ€™t so strong 
 that when you come back to 
 so fall back on you 
 
 wasn't it beautiful 
 
 a say to fall in love even just a part of this, a part of you 
 and i don't think it ever need love i'm standing at your door 
 i'll be living in the back of the room 
 i'm spinning around, i'm spinning around 
 and all i can feel you like your eyes 
 where were the reason for the teardrops on my guitar 
 the only one who's got enough of me to break 
 
 'cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you 
 i want you to chase after me 
 
 come back, come back, come back to me like 
 you would, you would if you could never take the time 
 to my lovin' 
 they might tell you 
 it all disappeared
