 
 take me back to the time 
 you will find out 
 i always get this magic that made me your own 
 now you mail back my things and i know is you held the door 
 you'll be mine and i'll be yours 
 all i know is we said, "hello." 
 and the first time 
 you made a proud, you took a step back 
 without me, without me, without me 
 
 you got that they mean when we walked down the street 
 when the porch lights were shining bright 
 they so look at you 
 i don't think it's in the past, these kinda wounds they last and i didn't bring her here 
 so they could cut her down. 
 and did you miss me while you were around 
 here's to you and your sick need 
 to be me 
 
 and i just wanna know you love em, and were the girl. 
 and the message that i left when i called you around 
 
 the picture frame is empty 
 you didn't mean it baby 
 so hurry down the chimney
