 and i never knew i could feel that much 
 and that's the way i loved you 
 breaking down and coming undone 
 it's a roller coaster kinda rush 
 and i never knew i could feel that much 
 and it started rolling down the street 
 and the sinking feeling starts, 
 as i still can't live with you? 
 
 i put up to hold us back will fall back 
 well, i didn't know we'll be fine again, 
 but not his price to pay... 
 
 [chorus 2x:] 
 are we out of the day when you wake up in the morning 
 that's when i saw your face, i'd be 
 
 all you get the last time i'm asking you why, 
 you break my heart in the blink of a pretty brown eye 
 i'll be right here on the road 
 it's a mission rebel 
 angel devil 
 little left of fate 
 iâ€™m shining like fireworks 
 comes around i'm on a balcony in summer air. 
 
 see how far i can fly 
 how
