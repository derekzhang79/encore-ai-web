 
 thinking about right now 
 in this moment the girl 
 picking daisies in the field 
 i know i'm not a nice new apartment 
 in a city, wouldn't you take a moment, promise me this 
 that this time is like a battle 
 but every night is flawless, don't you let it all 
 tried to stay 
 
 down this feeling 
 i hope you cry getting my r-e-v-e-n-g-e 
 
 so i'm not a little girl inside when we went in 
 i've been crying 
 baby, you know i haven't seen you hurt. 
 down the light down 
 out on 441 
 like waves crashing on the beach 
 
 and say life on musical road is rough conditions 
 but the start of an age 
 
 she died from complications 
 of the things you told you 
 i wish that all your roads would lead you right to me 
 
 it's the age of princesses and pirate ships 
 and the seven dwarfs 
 daddy's smart this year, is to work my way again 
 when weâ€™ll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing
