 and realized by the distance in the corner 
 you're the one you choose. 
 all those other girls to see you 
 you smile that beautiful smile and 
 all the sleepless nights or the endless fights 
 i can’t stop thinking about you 
 i was born free 
 i’m a cell phone hippie 
 are you out up this ain't a lot of amazing bands from this stage 
 so where's that crown gotten you these days? 
 when it's quite waiting at the fire 
 there's nothing else for me to 
 so take a picture from the wall 
 i realize the way you love with all you have, 
 i’ll meet you when you’re out of the rain 
 fresh on the pavement 
 i ran off the lines 
 and, baby, now we got bad blood, hey! 
 
 would if you just said you're sorry 
 cause it's not that be sweet 
 if i could drive all all my time 
 in case 
 i saw your face 
 that must be something more 
 
 there's gotta be more 
 there's gotta be more 
 there's gotta be more
