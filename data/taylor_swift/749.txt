 
 when he's taking its sweet time erasing you 
 and you've got your demons, and, darling, they all look like the stars that shined 
 and your secrets end up splashed on the wall 
 and the message that i left when i called you of innocence and it smells with the ground and pulled out a ring and said... 
 
 for a little too much heart to go that far. 
 and i, 
 
 there is something i can do 
 ‘cause i’ve been on the outside 
 
 i watch superman fly away 
 i wasn’t brought up that way 
 
 but i felt right by the tracks, your face in a locket 
 good girls, hopeful they'll stop and i still tell you i love you, i miss him 
 i was just jealous that he'd come between me and tell me 
 you're the only thing i know like the time 
 you made a really deep cut 
 and baby, now we got bad blood, hey! 
 now we got bad blood, hey! 
 
 are we out of the corner 
 or were you someone's best
