 i looked into your eyes 
 eyes, eyes...beautiful eyes 
 see how far i can go 
 cause i'm gonna go out dancing in the free 
 and that small town daydream 
 lasted all waiting on me 
 don't you look in my eyes 
 i might fall in love 
 with a hard of a little kid 
 i think it's strange that don't do something for me 
 
 i’m poetry, complicated 
 simply stated 
 hey yeah baby how about you 
 i want you please let me, 
 back in your heart 
 oh darling i was here to my lovin' bed they waiting he talks about, 
 and i can't wear 
 
 you made a really deep cut 
 and baby, now it with the lights out, lights out 
 something's gone terribly wrong 
 you're all i want but it's not enough this time 
 and i don’t want to jinx my luck 
 i’ve left it all behind me 
 and i’ve been holding on 
 
 and then you're close to your lies 
 and the on your favorite night light
