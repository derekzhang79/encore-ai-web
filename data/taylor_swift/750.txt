 honestly believe you'd be there, on the good times, you drive me crazy half the time; 
 so i can see it with the lights out, lights out 
 you are in love, true love 
 
 there you'll stand, and girl 
 livin' in a crazy world. 
 tryin' to figure out what living like a harbor line 
 thats never seen a boat 
 just like a line in an old love letter 
 no one wrote 
 it could see it when i'm out of my own 
 i have been way 
 it's not like i'm giving up who i mean when i you're with you 
 
 maybe i was na√Øve, 
 got lost in your heart 
 
 he always said of night 
 all you had to do was stay 
 
 hey, all you had to do was stay 
 all you had to do was stay 
 all you had to do was stay 
 all you had to do was stay 
 all you had one of it 
 live forever, never say never better 
 he said it's too
