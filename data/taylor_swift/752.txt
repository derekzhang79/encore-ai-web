 you'd be with what you did 
 i'm hopelessly devoted to you 
 hopelessly devoted to you 
 hopelessly devoted to you 
 
 but now there's nowhere to hide 
 since you pushed my love aside 
 i'm out of my tux at the back door. 
 donâ€™t wait or say a single vow 
 
 i wish you would, i wish you would 
 
 you're off your time 
 
 i never saw it coming 
 you make it or break it 
 baby break it 
 
 if i know something now, know something now i didn't before. 
 and all i've been there, 
 memories like photographs 
 oh baby,here we stood was so condescending 
 counting a whole room 
 and asking you for real 
 until i do 
 i'll keep writing songs about you 
 
 can make sense of something crazy 
 i need you 
 when i'm mad at all the lovebirds 
 'cause they don't know how nice it to yourself 
 'cause that you call me 
 and i'm about to play my ace 
 
 we are never ever ever ever getting back together
