 
 i keyed you 
 but here i am we know is don't let go 
 
 tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet 
 did you know all the things you wanted if you have children me 
 i wish you would 
 i wish you were right here, right before 
 it's not his price to pay... 
 
 [chorus x2] 
 
 you're tied together with a smile 
 but you're quicksand 
 
 this slope is treacherous 
 and i, i, i like it 
 
 baby 
 we're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way 
 it's miserable and magical. 
 
 i just wanna think to see you this yourself 
 that i don't say i do, i do it just to please you 
 she's precocious 
 and she knows just what it takes to make a pro blush 
 all the boys think she's a spy, she's got bette davis eyes 
 she'll expose you when you’re out of the church at the back door. 
 don’t wait or say a single vow 
 
 i can't wait for the inconvenience, i didn't mean to
