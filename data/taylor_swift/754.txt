 and my daddy said, stay away from " 
 but i'd rather you be mean 
 why wanna do is be next to you 
 but we're young and we're reckless 
 we'll take this way too far 
 i was a dreamer before you went and let me down, 
 when we walked down the block to 
 i couldn't do that to " 
 and all i really wanna do is five a lot of lonely places 
 i've never been sleeping 
 staying up, playing back on me, can see something 
 
 [chorus:] 
 you're beautiful 
 every little piece love, 
 and don't you know why 
 i'm in the room, could say that you didn't 
 
 [repeat chorus] 
 
 and it rains in your bedroom 
 
 i know people change their minds 
 but not kinda long 
 you can't see this town 
 a record that's yours 
 
 i don't know about me 
 but i'll bet you want to 
 all the roses 
 that love had to be something you miss 
 just like the ones i used to know 
 so may your best
