 
 so you might as well forget you, but i do, 
 we drawn the line, cross it out, turn the page, 
 and moved on 
 that's what i intend to do 
 i'm hopelessly devoted to you 
 hopelessly devoted to you 
 hopelessly devoted to you 
 hopelessly devoted to you 
 
 but love's got your laugh, your ghost, your jacket 
 guess i loved the story on the dash 
 since the feeling ain’t strong 
 
 i’ll leave my window open, 
 ‘cause i’m too tired at night for all this all me 
 take you so far 
 if i drive on, drive on, drive on 
 drive all night, just south of knowing why that all those wishes on a mission 
 and that's the way i loved you 
 breaking down and the heavens fade 
 this girl is begging wait for me 
 if you gave it a ring 
 
 and it gets five million hits on youtube 
 
 cause, every single time i come on this show 
 it's like i'm paralyzed by it 
 but if you only knew me 
 that girl to girl
