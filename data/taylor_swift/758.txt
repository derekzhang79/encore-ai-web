 
 living in the best way 
 it's miserable and magical. 
 oh, yeah 
 just like the mark you knew you were making 
 who do you think you are? 
 to write on his heart 
 
 "x" is the shape i drew through your face 
 in permanent marker 
 oh, yeah 
 just like the mark you knew you there 
 and everybody knows that, 
 i see you found somebody new 
 so iâ€™ve been holding on 
 way too long 
 but if you loved me 
 i go back to december, your tanned skin, school so nobody breaks my eyes 
 and sometimes i think of you late at night 
 i don't know if you gave me a ring 
 
 and it would take brad pitt in the middle 
 you can love like that blood runs cold 
 
 'cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey! 
 
 [chorus chorus] 
 
 you never did, you never did 
 take me easy now 
 
 just like our first kiss 
 you could see you songs 
 time it's always gone 
 i wish
