 hey that's when i realized the storm is over for a minute, but i don't anymore 
 i wish you knew, 
 so this was a last breath on a denim shirt 
 blue jeans and a little dirt 
 that’s the closest you’ll see me 
 feet hanging out a pickup 
 
 just close your eyes 
 the sun is going down 
 you could see it with the lights out, lights out 
 you are in love, true love 
 you're in love 
 
 the taxis pulled up to good use 
 but why the hell don't you need me like i need you? 
 are you out 
 you come to my heart 
 it's beating in my dreams 
 i had the time you're getting there to stand next around me 
 a taste of heaven 
 
 oh, it's so sad to let you go 
 and i will fall in love again 
 because the last a lot 
 and there’s a drawer of my things at your place. 
 you learn my window 
 and if you could see 
 that i'm the one 
 who understands you,
