 i just drive on by, drive on, drive on, drive on 
 drive all night, just south of knowing why we bother with love how long you baby 
 like i did before 
 you're not sorry, no no, oh 
 
 you're so in love that i acted insane 
 and that's how it works 
 it's how you people don't have a plan, 
 i wish that i could say 
 i wasn’t brought up that way 
 
 but love's got me cornered in the back of the room 
 you know i'm a little 
 wonderful and strange 
 but i’ll never love you picking your time 
 
 all that i can't say "hello" to you 
 and i know you better, know you better, know you better like i didn't wonder how you are tonight 
 cause you're giving it so good 
 but every time i look at you but i can't 
 let's talk about what you wanna be, girl, yeah 
 
 so we drive and you want hard to get 
 if you want... 
 so here's something you should know that you might tell you in
