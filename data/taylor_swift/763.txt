 with a little too much heart to go around 
 live forever, never say never 
 you could be trusted 
 did you know that? 
 
 well maybe it’s me 
 and all you have is to leave you 
 it takes me to that 
 but this love is ours 
 
 but here i was begging you, please don't " 
 and when i got home ... 'fore i said, "amen." 
 asking god if he could play it again 
 
 move out, find out 
 never a cowboy 
 you’ll see me 
 then i think there 
 i will face the world around me 
 knowing that i'm not a nice girl 
 
 i'm going out on a date 
 with your hair 
 i live in one small town 
 but you start to live with the pain 
 guess i loved you for real 
 but i do 
 turn the lock and put my headphones on 
 the small town lights 
 she got up again 
 she got up again 
 i hope these songs will sing you in this time. 
 to hold us back will fall
