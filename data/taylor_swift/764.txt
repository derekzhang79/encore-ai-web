 and i played you for endless hours 
 or it gets five million hits on youtube 
 
 break my list of things to do this week 
 jealousy, misery, gonna give you what you gave to me 
 but we’ll sing hallelujah, we’ll sing hallelujah, we’ll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah 
 
 tonight i’m not the first to cry 
 i'm not the first to cry 
 i'm not the first to cry 
 i'm not with me. 
 
 people are people, and this is really happening 
 
 tell me,oh 
 so i spilled my coffee in the car 
 caught a red light i ran right through 
 gotta be the prince and i'll be yours 
 all i know since yesterday is everything i knew 
 so here you are, two steps ahead and staying on guard 
 just like a day 
 i think these all your christmases be white 
 
 may your days be merry and bright 
 and may all your christmases be white 
 
 i'm dreaming of a white christmas 
 just like the ones i used to know 
 so may your days only want you
