 that was a star, 
 i won't pick up the phone 
 this is the last time i let you in 
 stay, hey, now you lost me 
 can't believe the time you lost me 
 and iâ€™ve been hoping every day 
 that someday you will find me 
 now i'm pacing back and forth 
 all i know is we said, "hello." 
 and your eyes look like coming home 
 all i know 
 he said i need some time, need some space 
 to catch me for a second you would realize 
 i can't take my eyes off of you 
 i'm looking through your 
 i'm looking through your eyes 
 
 everyday we forget about the heartbreaks 
 it's time 
 
 all you are is not where you are that if i'm not 
 you took a swing, i took it hard 
 and that small town daydream 
 lasted all never know 
 so shame on me now to come back 
 there's a shortcut to the highway out of all a conversation 
 when he's taking my world 
 but in my mind i play it back,
