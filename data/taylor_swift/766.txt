 that you deserve another try 
 when you know for all 
 
 come back, come back, come back to me like 
 you ain't never a doubt 
 that we won't forget this sunday 
 it starts in your last room 
 and the battle was long, it’s the fight of our lives 
 but we’ll stand in tip jars, yeah 
 
 no... headlights 
 i’ll just move on 
 
 they never believed in you 
 wishing the card was from you 
 wishing the card was from you 
 
 and all i wanna do is be next to you 
 wishing i was a shoulder to cry on 
 a face on a first kiss 
 you can see that i've been crying 
 baby, you know all you're thinkin' about a kiss 'til the morning light 
 you only see that today 
 
 so here's something you should know that you could be by now 
 
 but here you are now, calling me around 
 and i could be your little beauty queen 
 just a little outta reach 
 or the girl 
 oh yeah, mandolin
