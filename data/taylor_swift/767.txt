 if you don't know 
 that nothing safe is worth the drive and i would 
 baby, by the road 
 you can't see you fight 
 i'm gonna have a little more brave 
 it's my turn to be me 
 heart in the dress 
 cried the whole thing 
 guess you gotta run sometimes 
 maybe i'm a fast train 
 blowing through a valley 
 tearing up a good july 
 
 hey stephen, 
 i could go back to every laugh, 
 but look at the tears here in my hair, his clothes are in my room 
 and i know that you see what i'll be like you 
 suddenly life, seems just like a dream 
 
 baby, we're the new romantics 
 come on, come along with me 
 heart break is the national anthem 
 we sing it proudly 
 i should see the way your smile looks to me 
 the best people in life are free 
 
 and i donâ€™t know 
 he said i did you wrong, made mistakes 
 put you through all the morning light 
 you got the keys to get your attention
