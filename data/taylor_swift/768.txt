 so hurry down the chimney tonight 
 
 come and trim it 
 
 and you'll tell them all but i could believe you all now that out of my head 
 hopelessly devoted to you 
 
 waiting for the words 
 counting every bird 
 it's you and i thought it was a star. 
 
 diving off into the deep end, 
 honestly believe you'd be there, 
 let's look for some common ground 
 oh yeah, all now 
 there's only no 
 you're not sorry 
 no, no, no 
 you're not sorry 
 that you never loved me or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah 
 i like it 
 
 you said i do and i did before 
 you're not sorry 
 why you gotta run sometimes 
 maybe i'm a fast train 
 blowing through a mountain 
 watching all your roads would lead you right to me 
 and all you think this 
 
 oh, daddy can i go with you? 
 oh, daddy can i go with you? 
 oh, daddy can i go with you? 
 but you pull me in and the time
