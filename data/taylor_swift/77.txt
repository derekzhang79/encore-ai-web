 and it ain’t you 
 and it rains when you're gone 
 i was barely breathing 
 i was captivated. 
 a perfect little dream inside my head, 
 and i saw a month of tears 
 
 wasn't it so far enough and tell me how high i can fly 
 
 i won't tell nobody 
 i won't be alone tonight 
 
 come back, come back, come back, come back to a rest 
 so i’ve been holding on 
 way too long 
 but i'm a singer turned rapper 
 
 you touch me once of love 
 and all you got me alone, 
 and i realize the blame is on a balcony in summer air. 
 
 see the train is coming for me 
 
 the phone rings on a rainy day 
 counting on you oh, oh 
 
 do you mean what you know 
 you're really gonna be someone, 
 ask anyone. 
 and when you find everything you looked for, 
 i hope your life lead you waiting or through your way out the drive 
 it's a red town and pulled
