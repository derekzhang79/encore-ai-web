 
 down came the rain 
 lightning and thunder 
 we tried in vain 
 to the crickets sing. 
 flowers pile up in you, i can do 
 â€˜cause what we started 
 he knew that i'll never forget you as long as i live. 
 and i wish you were right here, right now, it's all good. 
 i wish you would 
 
 say you'll remember me 
 standing in a nice dress, 
 on sinking ships 
 you showed up what living life so quiet 
 that was a small town 
 man you better run 
 you better run 
 you better run 
 you better run 
 you better run 
 you better run 
 faster than my bullet 
 
 ellen works a long day 
 giving weird interviews in a slick, cool sweater 
 and we caught onto something 
 that i had the best day 
 when i said, i'll never forget you from the very first day 
 but not this all me 
 take this chance, i'll make you mine 
 
 can't call your picture in a frame 
 you know
