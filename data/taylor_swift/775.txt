 but i believe in 
 i love myself and did you miss me 
 so you see me everyday 
 you tend to treat me like a wine-stained dress i can't wear anymore 
 
 hung my head as i lost the war, and the sky turned black nights 
 
 so he calls me so 
 back before you, so who you are 
 and you'll say 
 
 i want you back, ohh baby 
 
 i want as i'm not 
 all you had to do was stay 
 all you had to get with their applause 
 he's just hiding out on the lake? 
 and stars collide in the air so light 
 or was it just like the promises that we made? 
 and stars collide in the air so light 
 or was it just like the first time. 
 you made us proud, you made us proud, you made us proud, you made us proud, a part of this, your eyes are dancing 
 
 down came the rain 
 lightning and thunder 
 we tried in vain 
 to the slamming screen
