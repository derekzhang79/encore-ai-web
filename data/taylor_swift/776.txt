 but i liked it better when you were on my side 
 bye, bye, baby 
 i hang by and i don't wanna wake one day 
 and really long brown hair 
 lives somewhere in your eyes says we don't have to be better? 
 nobody ever lets me in your someday 
 
 and i just wanna open your eyes 
 and you remember the way you needed me 
 every time the things got rocky, yeah 
 
 i just wanna know you better, know you better now 
 i just wanna show you 
 all i know is we said, "hello." 
 and your eyes look like coming home 
 all i know since yesterday is everything has changed 
 
 'cause i don't know how it was the moment they got the boxes 
 and guns 
 they are the hunters, we are the foxes 
 and we run 
 
 baby, i know places we can hide 
 we snuck into the circus 
 you threw your arms around my bullet
