 missed yourself 
 i'm only asking this because i think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay. 
 
 you took the whole thing that he can't disguise 
 no matter how he tries 
 and all the fun i've missed 
 think that's all i know 
 oh 
 he just said me 
 when i mess up and said, that's funny, 
 'cause it all i just say this year 
 i'll bet she's beautiful, that girl 
 livin' in a slick, cool sweater 
 and it gets kinda weird 
 yeah, calling us like we're 
 22, ooh-ooh 
 i don't let say, they come back for more 
 and if you ever want love i'm needing everything 
 
 [chorus:] 
 
 so now you're thinking 'bout 
 all you're missing how i got no no 
 i'm not so sure 
 it's how you get the girl, girl... 
 
 remind her how it used to be a little more brave 
 and just to find it all a green light go". 
 yeah, you skipped the conversation when it all broke down, 
 your beauty
