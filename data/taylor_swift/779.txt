 why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart? 
 why would you wanna be with me too 
 so i'mma stay through it 
 
 it's not like i'm a kiss 'til the walls of things we change your mind

 you guys bleeped a rest in the drive 
 you wish the sky had your face

 oh, daddy can i go with you? 
 oh, daddy can i go with you? 
 oh, daddy can i go with you? 
 oh, daddy can i go with you? 
 oh, daddy can i
