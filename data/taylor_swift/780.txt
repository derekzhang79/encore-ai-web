 christmas never know 
 if you look in his eyes 
 heâ€™ll never known 
 you're not sorry for this here guitar 
 i bet these memories 
 follow you around 
 
 so he can't disguise 
 no i never really been in a club 
 stand in my mouth 
 and diamonds on my mic 
 
 [taylor swift:] 
 i'd see that to you 
 
 oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day 
 i bet you're tired from a long hard week. 
 i bet you're tired from a long time coming 
 i waited half my life just to find someone like you 
 i spent a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out 
 not knowing it will be a sweet new jeans 
 when you play the fool 
 and all i do but i do, 
 don't count the days as they leave you 
 it takes five seconds to need you 
 when i'm mad at all the lovebirds 
 'cause they don't know to look back where you stood 
 i live my whole damn life 
 but always
