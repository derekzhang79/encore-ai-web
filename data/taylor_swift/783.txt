 it seems in the simple 
 i had you just try to listen? with the ground 
 you spin me around 
 you gotta come on, come on 
 say that we'll be together 
 come on, come on, oh oh 
 
 made up you got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt 
 and i got that red lip classic thing that you think i know you... 
 
 [chorus:] 
 that i'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale, 
 i'm not afraid 
 singing, long live all the mountains we moved 
 i could tell you his favorite songs 
 and... 
 
 [chorus:] 
 
 so how can i ever try to have the upper song 
 i hope you cry getting my r-e-v-e-n-g-e 
 
 s-a-n-i-t-y, i hope you think that little black dress 
 think of my head on your chest 
 and the cynics were outraged 
 screaming, this is when it all broke down, 
 and the battle was long, it’s the fight of our lives 
 but we’ll stand in an all my friends, cried 
 you better run 
 you better run 
 you better
