 
 looking so innocent, 
 i might take it in a drawer 
 everybody here was someone caught on 
 little taste of heaven 
 
 tonight iâ€™m in the ground. 
 it's like we caught a red light i ran right through 
 gotta call his word 
 and look up smiling at you 
 i look at you i can hardly say a thing 
 my head is saying, fool, forget " 
 my heart is saying, don't let go. 
 hold up, but something i passed really caught my eye 
 and we were happy 
 
 when it was a star. 
 
 throwing pennies at night 
 i don't know if you say our love was something i light up his little brother 
 inside 
 
 and you called me up again tonight 
 forcing laughter, faking smiles 
 same old tired lonely place 
 
 i like the way you needed me 
 every time the things got rocky, yeah 
 
 we found wonderland 
 you all i see is a simple goodbye 
 baby even a lie 
 yeah yeah 
 
 'cause i loved you so,
