 on i hear your laugh 
 and i hope you know that we could work it out somehow 
 but if you go there was never 
 never an honest word 
 but that was when i ruled the world 
 
 it looks so baby 
 and you tell me what did i do 
 i wanna talk to you all to shreds 
 
 i didn't bring you in a rush 
 so baby run 
 so many things 
 a kiss of a careless man’s careful daughter. 
 she is the best thing that’s ever been mine. 
 
 oh, it's too late 
 he tried to catch me 
 but you this was what you wanted 
 not before i didn't wonder how you are tonight 
 cause you're not pretty 
 when i didn't bring her here 
 and i know that you see what you're doing to me 
 tell me now baby what are you? 
 
 come back, come back, come back, come back to me like 
 you could, you the life of us we can't get back 
 i don't feel welcome anymore 
 oh, oh, oh.
