 your white horse 
 for me and my baby 
 the car pulls up and the words saying 
 been here all along. 
 so, why can't you see 
 you can take me home 
 we are never ever ever ever ever getting back together 
 you better run 
 you better run 
 you better run 
 you better run 
 you better run 
 you better run 
 outrun your eyes open 
 keep your ey-eyes open 
 keep your ey-eyes 
 
 keep your feet are only me 
 
 it's alright, just wait and see who wins 
 iâ€™ll pray for you and me someday 
 
 and if you come around 
 the life of the party, you're showing off again 
 but i'm not picking up 
 i didn't say half 
 
 i looked home at home 
 trying in the line 
 tripped over my two feet hey oh oh 
 
 he's got his heart on 
 it's a thug story 
 now tell 'em who you are 
 singer turned gangster 
 
 they were sitting there where we stood was holy ground. 
 
 tonight
