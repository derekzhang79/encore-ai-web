 but if we loved again, i swear it's that guy who broke up with a broken heart you broken 
 hey yeah whatâ€™s the word on you 
 and then you say, 
 there was something wrong, it was all my fault 
 i had it all, what a shame, what a fall now 
 but that you were 
 stripped before you only 
 you are the mean 
 when you're standing on a plane, 
 i thought it was a star. 
 
 and i think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay. 
 
 stay, stay, stay. 
 i've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time. 
 you think that it's funny when i'm mad, mad, mad. 
 so i was leaving too soon 
 and i know it's right for you 
 and i never did 
 i've been spending the last eight months 
 
 long live the walls you put your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right. 
 and i'll be loving you for quite some time, time, time. 
 you think that it's funny when i'm mad,
