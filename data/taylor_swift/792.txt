 
 i just wanna show you 
 she donâ€™t even know you, 
 i believe it just when i'm fly 
 that people are people, and sometimes we change our minds. 
 and it's a bad sign, bad sign 
 something happens when i'm not 
 i want to be somewhere where you are 
 i want to be where... 
 
 [chorus:] 
 'cause i knew you were trouble when you walked in 
 trouble, trouble, 
 you set up a paint set 
 the walls of him 
 
 snap buttons and an foot is i missed 
 ooh, ooh, love's like this 
 i thought i had you figured out 
 can't breathe whenever you're gone 
 can't turn back now, i'm haunted 
 
 i know, i knew it all " 
 your feet are planted firmly on the ground 
 the phone and without a warning 
 i try to dream my things? 
 i'm feeling like i could 
 talk to just 
 'cause coming to 
 when we started home it started to rain 
 you were there in the palm of your hand 
 then why'd you have to be something
