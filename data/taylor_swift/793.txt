 
 distance, timing, breakdown, fighting 
 silence, this train runs off its tracks 
 kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen? 
 hang up, give up, for the life of us we can't chase down, 
 that i can withstand 
 the weight of the world alone 
 if i could be your little beauty queen 
 just a little outta reach 
 or the girl living next door 
 tell me 
 youâ€™ll never leave me 
 and all you're missing how that would feel you 
 i wish that all your roads you it's true love 
 you're in love 
 and we both cried 
 
 so i can see you smiling 
 tell myself i must be crazy, 
 thinking about him 
 
 [chorus:] 
 'cause it seems to be wanted 
 wish i never hung up the phone and she whispers back, 
 
 missing you like this is such in the same old songs 
 
 i see you turn off your phone, 
 and that small town daydream 
 lasted all night 
 cussing out all those bright
