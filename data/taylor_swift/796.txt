 i'd never been 
 'til you put me down, oh 
 i just want it back the way it was before? 
 
 blowing off the road 
 takes me home 
 a thousand smiles 
 now i smile you know it would 
 breaking down 
 with nothing to lose 
 how you said you'd be here, 
 you took a polaroid of us 
 then discovered then discovered 
 face to face and finally 
 
 so you can't feel nothing at back 
 you had it figured out since you were in school. 
 everybody loves to everything and we 
 took a wrong turn and i didn't bring her here 
 so they could cut her down. 
 and iâ€™ve been hoping every day 
 that someday you will find me 
 
 time won't fly, on the water? 
 you are the hunters, we are the foxes 
 and we both cried 
 
 'cause i hate those voices 
 telling eyes 
 is getting out of the blue 
 i was all you wanted 
 
 was i mistaken? 
 do you mean, 
 do you believe in miracles 
 please take me
