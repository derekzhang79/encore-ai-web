 and you'll come back each time how much clean 
 think i see your face 
 i let you in, baby that's when 
 someday all in my head 
 in burning red 
 burning, it was red 
 
 these days i haven't been out of my head 
 hopelessly devoted to you 
 
 but now there's nowhere to hide 
 since you pushed my love aside 
 i'm out of my head 
 but he leaves you out like a penny in the rain 
 and it's 2am and i'm the same 
 and you and i'll be safe and sound... 
 before i let them see me 
 see the train is coming for me 
 so it could stay 
 but i couldn't find wings 
 but you know you only get one 
 or then you talk 
 one night he wakes 
 strange look at you 
 last time i'm asking you, 
 last time i'm asking you, 
 last time i'm asking you this, 
 come back... be here, come back... be here. 
 
 i don't wanna miss you like this, 
 come back... be here, come back... be
