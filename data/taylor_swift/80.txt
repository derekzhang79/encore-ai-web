 a girl in a little little stars, spelling out your name 
 you gotta come on, come on 
 little taste of heaven 
 
 just close your eyes 
 you'll be alright 
 come on, come on saying oh 
 
 it's half full and i wish you were right here, right now, it's all good. 
 i wish you would 
 
 i, i, i, i, i shake it off, i shake it off 
 it's not fun 
 
 tell me, did the wind sweep you off the day 
 once you're gone i know your memory'll 
 somehow get the best of me 
 so catch a cab, 
 lose my number, 
 all i could see was you and i. 
 i was captivated. 
 a perfect little dream inside my head, 
 and then you walk right by, i'm screaming out inside 
 why you gotta love again 
 tell me 
 
 bye, bye, to everything i thought was on my side 
 watching all my life go by 
 
 yeah, i said, that's when i wake up in a pretty light that you dance 
 and i'll take them in
