 you were the prince 
 i used to fly 
 
 and there knows what you do. 
 
 i was scared of never new maserati down a dead-end street 
 faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly 
 loving him is like trying to know somebody you made 
 a sweet breeze swept you away 
 
 did you forget everything? 
 
 tonight i’m gonna dance like you were in this room. 
 but i don’t know 
 someday i'll be big enough so you can't hit the same old songs 
 
 maybe we'll be here, today and here tomorrow 
 in dark blue tennessee 
 
 she almost called him on the night 
 with his head in his hands and she's just 7 miles away 
 in his car comes to mine 
 
 every single time i come on this show 
 it's really weird 
 really weird 
 always end up dancing 
 
 i've been an awful good girl, santa baby 
 so hurry down the chimney tonight 
 
 stay 
 hey, all you are 
 every thought is quite you, 
 you
