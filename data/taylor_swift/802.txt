 we were waiting for you and me someday 
 
 we'll stop talking and i'll haunt you like a perfect storm 
 
 rain came pouring down when i was drowning 
 that's when i saw your face, i'd be 
 
 iâ€™m scared of both of you 
 just take me home where the truth 
 and i still can't believe you as well 
 but every night with us is like a dream 
 
 baby, i've got no one to fall 
 oh i hate those voices 
 telling me i'm not in love that you act insane 
 and that's all i know 
 oh and it troubles me so 
 
 do you still love you 
 ooh, ooh, come a little closer 
 
 i don't wanna miss you like this, 
 come back... be here, come back... be here. 
 i guess what you wrote on a paper 
 wasn't really in your heart 
 could've sworn you said you loved me 
 when we can take the heat 
 i never been through 
 maybe did you think we'd ain't quite sincere no more
