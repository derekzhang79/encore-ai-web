 i ran off the doors 
 i call you in, 
 i just wanna know you better, know you better now 
 i just wanna turn around 
 and all i had to do was stay 
 all you had to do what's upstanding and right, 
 
 everything i do 
 unsure of turning you away 
 wondering to call 
 and i got that red lip classic thing that you like 
 and when love hands me matches now 
 i'm gonna burn it down 
 a stranger in an all night diner 
 waiting for her love to leave you 
 it takes five seconds to need you 
 when i'm mad at all the lovebirds 
 'cause they don't know how long it's gonna take the what i catch your flight, 
 
 oh darling i was blind to let you take a place in this world 
 
 oh 
 
 think of all the fun i've missed 
 think of all your roads at me. 
 wind in the best way 
 it's miserable and magical. 
 oh, yeah 
 ooh-ooh, ye-e-e-e-eah, hey 
 i stood right by the music
