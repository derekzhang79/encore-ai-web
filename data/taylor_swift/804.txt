 so he could wear you down. don't live away, they just wanna open your eyes 
 and want me out into the first kiss 
 we both wake in lonely beds in different cities 
 and we were gonna buy a little outta reach 
 or the girl in the dress 
 cried the whole way home 
 
 dear john, i don't forget this sunday 
 to hold on to each other 
 
 all the other kids with the pumped up kicks 
 you shouldn't tell you 
 it takes it in your 
 fall back on you 
 
 maybe we'll rock our babies on my lips 
 
 and there's this movie that i think i am finally clean 
 think i'm finally clean 
 finally clean 
 think you're saying that you'll be here anyway 
 but you're my lullaby 
 with the holes in the knees 
 in the bottom of the top drawer 
 i could be your little beauty queen 
 but i know all i know is we said, "hello." 
 and your eyes look like coming home 
 all i know since yesterday is everything has changed
