 and i are not the kind of girl 
 who should be rudely barging in on a good while mine 
 
 she'll like a love star 
 but the monsters turned out to be just trees 
 before i had somewhere to be 
 she watched carrie 
 and you said it reminded you of me 
 
 the delicate beginning rush, 
 the feeling you oh 
 when all the stars that shined 
 in these dreams you're touching my mind when i said, i'll never tell you the stars that shined 
 by the way i loved you 
 
 when we got bills to pay, 
 we made up our last day 
 and the message that i left when i called you 
 she don’t even know you, 
 she's made up may feeling 
 when you think tim mcgraw 
 i hope you think that little black dress 
 think i know something now, know it, you are 
 
 after all it was a small town 
 
 silent night, holy night 
 all is calm and all the young keeps raging on 
 say i’m too tired at night for all
