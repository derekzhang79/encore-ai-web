 
 [repeat chorus] 
 
 so he could be home that way 
 
 ain't a fairy star 
 and you don't know, what you put me through, 
 i had to, 
 
 wake up and smell the break-up, 
 fix my heart put on my make-up, 
 another mess i can't take my eyes off of you 
 i'm looking through your eyes 
 
 and i need you like a green light go". 
 what would you go 
 and you'll know you didn't i want a yacht and really just say yes". 
 
 and i hate you but i think you see that 
 
 got his problems, bills to pay... 
 
 [chorus x2] 
 
 you're tied there, with the one thing i thought would never leave me 
 i bet these memories 
 follow you of innocence and it smells like one of those nights, 
 we ditch the whole scene. 
 it feels like one of those nights, 
 we won't be sleeping. 
 it feels like one of those nights, 
 you look like bad news. oh 
 a smile 
 but you're coming undone 
 it's a roller
