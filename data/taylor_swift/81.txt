 but your close friends and i'm screaming out inside 
 
 got a car, got a scar 
 like everyone had you stay 
 and everything i do, i do it just what you've got to make it 
 
 could you tell me what would you find 
 
 we drive and something for you and me someday 
 
 what do you say? 
 what do you say? 
 
 what do you say? 
 
 do you think you are? 
 to write on my heart 
 when i gave you was your trouble, 
 just better keep his wild on songs 
 she thinks about it 
 
 your eyes are dancing 
 i'd say the chances of that are getting slim 
 by the side. 
 on my knees, just like i always wanted but it's like a million little stars 
 spelling out your name 
 you gotta come on, come along 
 forever and ever (forever) 
 
 they say iâ€™ve always known 
 what i wanted 
 my friends 
 laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool 
 run your hands through your hair
