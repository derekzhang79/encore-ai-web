 i won't 
 let's go fishing a lot of lonely places 
 guess only you said, when i'm not 
 i let them all in that mine 
 
 the way you look, the way you laugh, 
 the way you love with all you 
 
 spinning me around 
 and you're tied together and come on 
 little taste of the year 
 
 and the people as they make it in the silence, silence 
 you can feel it all i wanna do 
 is follow you 
 
 say that you wanna be with you someday 
 i'll be right here on the ground 
 may your days be merry and bright 
 and may all your christmases be white 
 
 may your days be merry and bright 
 and may all your christmases be white 
 
 i'm dreaming of a white christmas 
 just like the ones i used to know 
 so may your eyes open 
 
 everybody's waiting for you to come save me 
 donâ€™t need you 
 and i are paintin' your year 
 
 and i just wanna show you 
 all you're missing
