 and all i see is you 
 
 waiting for the words 
 counting every bird 
 i remember what you said last night 
 but ooh, you called me up again 
 that you were so damn cute 
 i need you run 
 run 
 oh baby run 
 run 
 oh baby run 
 run 
 oh baby run 
 faster than my bullet 
 
 ellen works a long day 
 giving weird interviews in a slick, cool sweater 
 and it rains when you're gone 
 'cause i was there when you say you love em, and baby without you, 
 i'd be 
 right here right now, i feel it on the way home 
 
 i see you found somebody new 
 and people were strangers watching 
 today was a fairytale 
 all the sleepless nights 
 the wind is blowing and we're reckless 
 we'll take this way too far 
 it'll leave you breathless 
 hey, hey what do you say? 
 what do you say? 
 what do you know when you go 
 and every day is like you were looking for yourself?
