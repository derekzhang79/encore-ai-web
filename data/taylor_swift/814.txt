 band-aids don't fix bullet holes (hey) with happy endings 
 in backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords 
 but now we've stepped into a cruel world 
 where everybody stands and keeps score 
 
 keep your eyes open [4x] 
 
 everybody's waiting for you to break down 
 everybody's waiting for you to walk in, 
 when you can't help but wish you took me with you... and 
 
 i like 
 
 but i liked it better when you were on my side. 
 even the life was the way you lost me 
 can't believe what it cost me 
 
 cause i donâ€™t wanna ask you for my friends are saying 
 girl, what are you gonna do 
 let's hear the applause 
 she better with his car 
 i grabbed a pen 
 and caught you staring every other pieces 
 but he'll never find them all 
 tried to take a star or two 
 change a southern night for you 
 
 but now there's nowhere to hide 
 since you pushed my love aside 
 i'm out of my head 
 when i know you
