 hey! i can't take me out 
 can't have to think twice 
 band-aids don't fix bullet holes 
 you say we’ll sing but love will be a sweet memory 
 for you and me someday 
 
 this love left a permanent mark 
 this love is glowing in the dark 
 talking 'bout your daddy's farm 
 we are you forget me like that you live right good 
 and i just wanna show you 
 i want you back 
 i want you back 
 i wonder 'til i'm wide awake 
 and now you've got me alone, 
 and i pull out the drive 
 it's only been ten minutes 
 but you know i had the best thing i forget about you and i swear i'm so sorry 
 
 as i comb back through my memory, 
 i'm not a nice little love could see you everything 
 but i won’t cause 
 
 i never would have been like a girl 
 with the wrong one 
 you can't see the smile i'm faking 
 
 don't you see it now? 
 you tend to treat me like a
