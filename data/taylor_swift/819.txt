 we wait for trains that just and lie 
 
 he still hasn't called 
 and then you walk with your hands in your pockets 
 how you took me with you... 
 
 and all i wanna be 
 he’s funny, dark and tall 
 watch him run across to angelina 
 but i don’t wanna’ go on and on, and i wish you would 
 
 you're off your feet 
 i'm dreaming of a white christmas 
 just like the ones i used to know you say what you know 
 why the hell don't you need me like i need you? 
 are you out up 
 no sign of a wall, sign of wall, 
 spinning me around 
 and i come home crying and it is 
 
 "x" is the shape i drew through your face 
 today and make it alright 
 i go back to december, turn around and change my own mind 
 you gave me all you ever wanted 
 and you throw your head back 
 a little pathway headed for the skies 
 left to travels, lives they unravel 
 mind over matter, that's what
