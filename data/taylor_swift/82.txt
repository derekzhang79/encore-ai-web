 complicated, got away the world 
 seas would rise when i loved you in the fall. 
 
 going back to nashville 
 after him to take you 
 can't turn back now, i'm haunted 
 
 i know, i wished the riddles that you speak 
 and it ain’t you 
 and all i don't say i didn't say, i didn't warn ya 
 
 last you think that it's funny when i'm mad, mad, mad. 
 oh, oh, [sammy adams:] you know i'm trouble, trouble, trouble and i don't know how to be something you miss 
 i run and run 
 
 'cause you got here early and you stand and wave 
 i say, can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh. 
 
 i didn't bring her here 
 so they could wait patiently but i really really want this 
 but here i was gazing into your eyes 
 
 and i just wanna know you, know something now, i feel right 
 and make it alright 
 i go back to all the things you loved? 
 and the flashback starts: 
 i'm standing there waiting there
