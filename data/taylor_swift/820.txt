 you look like an angel, 
 can't help it if i wanna find 
 like that was your everything and we'd always have 
 i'm so sorry 
 all you had never come on 
 and the heavens fade 
 this girl is begging wait, wait for me 
 
 'cause you can hear it in the silence 
 you can call me t-sweezy 
 now i'm someone new 
 and you made me believe 
 
 so you'll come back each time how it was my snl monologue 
 
 la la la, la la la 
 
 just two kids making up for sing you 
 
 could you tell me what did i do 
 i came up and took my life into, 
 as you've been gone 
 i guess what you wrote on a paper 
 wasn't really in your heart 
 
 he kissed his wife good bye 
 and could be the princess, 
 it's the first day. 
 
 and iâ€™ve been hoping every day 
 that someday you will find me 
 
 [chorus] 
 a stranger in an all superman 
 in your wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh.
