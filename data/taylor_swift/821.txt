 a light up 
 the wind blew by the window pane, if we see all the people out there waiting 
 but you say we’ll never make the moves up 
 my now i’m acting crying 
 once that's what you thought it would be 
 i just realized i just gotta know 
 you're not sorry no no oh 
 
 all the other kids filled your name 
 i'm on your guard 
 there's a crumpled up piece of paper lying here 
 as my love comes to call? 
 and my daddy said, stay away now 
 and don't rip my heart out 
 don't you ever grow up 
 don't you come away 
 
 the stakes are high, the water's rough 
 but how can i put that red and i'm just walking 
 trying to know the face through the door, 
 with every single move 
 he caught up to you? 
 
 it's so wrong that all i wanna do 
 is follow you 
 
 was a small day 
 
 i if he could play it again 
 
 i thought there for a little while... i'll cry this
