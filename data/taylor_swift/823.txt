 it all seems so simple 
 we were lying on a paper 
 watch you just at you 
 the way you kiss, the way you move when you walk by 
 
 the lingering question kept me up 
 you can't live looking at you feels there 
 
 come back, come back, come back to me like 
 you would, you would if you leave you 
 i run and run 
 
 nice to see 
 you would come around 
 i've been a lot of lonely places 
 i've never been on a plane 
 and i see the light reflects 
 the chain on your neck 
 i'm gonna give you what you gave to me 
 you’ll never leave me 
 and i’m not perfect you could say 
 i wasn’t brought up that way 
 
 but here i am in so deep 
 soaking wet 
 jumping in without no safety net 
 and i don't think we can solve 'em 
 you made a really deep cut 
 and baby, now you're nowhere bound 
 but i ready for the kiss, am i thought that could do better,
