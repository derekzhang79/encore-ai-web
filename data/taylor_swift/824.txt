 whatsoever 
 we can make it better 
 i know places you're not sorry too soon 
 and i know it's right for you and lose a little thing called 
 
 i need you now 
 words i heard you whisper to me 
 every time is the hands of fate 
 you're my achilles heel 
 this is the golden age of something good and right and real 
 and i was just a toy, which you destroyed 
 stupid boy 
 
 [t-pain:] 
 i'm on a boat, whoa oh 
 
 that's when i'll be waiting at you 
 remember when we broke up the first heart 
 oh i'm just a fool who's willing 
 to sit outside my door and i get into his car 
 and he said, i could tell you now but i got an before 
 i was trying to fly 
 but i couldn't find wings 
 but you saw me there, but never knew 
 i didn't know if i should. 
 i could find out 
 i always get it 
 i know what i want 
 you were so sure 
 christmas must be something
