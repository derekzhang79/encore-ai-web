 just a little outta reach 
 or the girl living next door 
 i'll be your everything tonight 
 let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one. 
 let me tell you i've been feeling like a mess 
 and we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah 
 
 wish you could go back the time 
 
 i have been looking in, trying to read your mind 
 give you the benefit of the doubt, every single time 
 and put a wreath up on your door 
 
 with a fear of fallin’ 
 wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts 
 
 all we know that you ain’t used to no 
 and i wish i could wanna see you, love it's not a day when you took a chance in my eyes 
 i might fall in love 
 with a he's got a smile that takes me to where i know is 
 i don't know about me you don't know 
 
 your very first day 
 come back... be here, come back... be here. 
 
 for a sure on a lonely
