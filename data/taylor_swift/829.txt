 and sometimes i think of you late at night 
 and i’ve been hoping every day 
 that you come back too 
 fall back on me 
 
 tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet 
 come running headlong into my arms 
 breathless 
 i'll never judge you 
 i can only love you 
 the way you didn't my walls are we had 
 to see me like you do. 
 and you talk real slow 
 'cause i gotta run sometimes 
 maybe i'm a storm front 
 blowing through the keys 
 even when you're sleeping, sleeping 
 keep your ey-eyes 
 
 keep your eyes open 
 keep your ey-eyes open 
 keep your ey-eyes open 
 keep your ey-eyes 
 
 keep your feet ready 
 heartbeat steady 
 keep your eyes open 
 keep your ey-eyes open 
 keep your ey-eyes 
 
 keep your feet ready 
 heartbeat steady 
 keep your eyes open [4x] 
 
 everybody's waiting for you but you’re out of my head 
 i know it's wrong 
 i bet these memories 
 follow you
