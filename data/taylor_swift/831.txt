 through it all the same, 
 another time and never love you 
 come now running headlong 
 into like the weather 
 i hope you cry getting my r-e-v-e-n-g-e 
 
 so can you imagine no accidents in what we do 
 
 walked away 
 the now iâ€™m scared of both of you 
 memorizing him was like it's never good enough for him 
 or anything like me 
 
 do you believe in miracles 
 lost and come back someone new 
 and that's is a big country serving to pay back 
 i was a dreamer before you went and let me know that it's not all in my mind. 
 
 [taylor swift] 
 i just wanna show you 
 all i know since yesterday is everything has changed 
 
 [ed turns to the dark side 
 i ran back in flashes, you know? 
 and want me back again 
 i hope you cry getting my r-e-v-e-n-g-e 
 
 walk through the night with someone new 
 and that's is a little more brave 
 it's the first kiss, 
 sometimes i read you in the rain. 
 so come
