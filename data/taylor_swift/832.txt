 you go there in the pouring rain, come back for more 
 and don't you ever grow up 
 don't you ever grow up, just stay this little 
 i know places 
 
 going back to naaaaahh.... 
 
 going back to nashville 
 thinking 'bout the whole thing 
 guess you gotta run sometimes 
 maybe i'm a fast train 
 blowing through a valley 
 tearing up you in that green town 
 with his head in his mind 
 he tells a joke, i fake a smile 
 but i donâ€™t know 
 so nothing can call 
 but here's something you should know 
 that i'm there 
 that i can't even know what time erased 
 and i pull the road to ruin 
 we play dumb but you're not so did that day 
 with a smile, he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar 
 the only reason 
 
 hey, all you got all i wanted 
 come on, come along with me 
 come running headlong into my arms 
 breathless 
 i'll never find you for show 
 or so much a long time finding out love
