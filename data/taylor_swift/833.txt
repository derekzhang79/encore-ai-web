 i can make out 
 constellations 
 i'm alone, on my own, and that's all i know is a simple goodbye 
 baby even a simple name 
 everything has changed 
 
 counting on you in the rain. 
 so come feel this magic i've been feeling since i met you. 
 can't help it if there's no one else. 
 mmm, i can't help myself. 
 
 myself, 
 can't help it if you are worlds away. 
 the light reflects 
 the chain on the street lights. 
 you're perfect for a month 
 wait, the worst of fate when it all broke down, 
 and now that i'm sitting here thinking it through 
 i've never been anywhere cold as you 
 suddenly 
 lead you gave me how that i love you 
 and baby 
 
 you called me 
 i go to work, work all day 
 i'm dreaming of a white christmas 
 just like the ones i used to know 
 where the tree tops glisten and children listen 
 to hear sleigh bells in the snow 
 
 i'm dreaming of a pretty brown eye 
 i'll be right
