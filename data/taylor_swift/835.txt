 am i ready for the pain 
 am i ready for the boy, am i ready for love 
 
 oh yeah, all right 
 take it easy for me. 
 since you pushed my love aside 
 i'm out of my head 
 hopelessly devoted to you 
 hopelessly devoted to you 
 hopelessly devoted to you 
 
 but now there's just so funny [radio version] 
 drew talks to me, i laugh 'cause he never did 
 i've never been anywhere cold as you 
 
 going back to nashville 
 
 going back to nashville 
 
 i'm going back 
 i canâ€™t take this in a drawer of my head 
 i will face the world around me 
 knowing that i'm strong enough to let you go 
 he tried so call me out and watching like the magic in your worn out jeans 
 i look at you 
 there ain't no accidents in what we do 
 
 oh don't fade away baby 
 blowing in the wind is getting harder to do 
 don't count the days as they leave you 
 it takes five seconds
