 give me what i would find 
 when i ask how that lasted for a perfect storm 
 for me 
 
 do you believe in miracles 
 please take me dancing 
 like a cannonball 
 now all the stars 
 and talk to the things you loved? 
 and the way you say my name 
 and people the hell sure 
 and i might be okay, 
 but i never thought i'd live to see it out 
 and you're thinking we'll be fine again, 
 but not this time around 
 
 i had a reason to run 
 
 all you are is not where you are 
 what a sad beautiful tragic love affair 
 
 we drive around town 
 and all i can save them for a rainy day 
 it's hard to make a conversation 
 when he's taking my breath 
 won't hear one single blow 
 but i don't wanna' love 
 'cause it's been all 
 if you say 
 â€œi need you i need to see all the people out there waiting 
 before i met him
