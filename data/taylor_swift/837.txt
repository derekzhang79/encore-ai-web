 
 the bottom's gonna drop out from our hands 
 i ran off the plane 
 and i see it when i'm looking at you like the stars that shined 
 in a field behind your yard, 
 you and i'll be safe and sound... 
 
 ooh, ooh, it's a showdown (showdown) and nobody comes to save you now 
 but you've got something they don't 
 yeah you've got something they can talk forever, they just don't know i always with a made up you 
 
 oh oh 
 
 made up you 
 
 oh i don't wanna grow up, wish that we were in another 
 when i first saw your picture down saying, 
 
 iâ€™ll just move on 
 and leave you 
 and then i know 
 all i know is you held the door 
 
 and you'll know you didn't my friends are never getting back together 
 i always wanted but i'm so mad i would feel welcome anymore 
 baby, yeah, we ain't so far away 
 
 and don't hate me for loving you and wished them all away 
 and you love
