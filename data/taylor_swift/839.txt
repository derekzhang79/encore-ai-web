 just know i’m right here hopin’, 
 that you’ll come in with the rain. 
 
 i could go back to december, turn around and change my own mind 
 i go back to december, turn around and change my own mind 
 i go back to december all the time. 
 
 i still miss you 
 and it's all about you 
 and i'm down to the dark 
 you're a redneck heartbreak 
 who's really bad at lying 
 so take a look what you've done look what you've found you even 
 missed yourself 
 i'm only up when you're not down. 
 don't wanna come back down 
 
 and we drive and drive 
 until we've found a town 
 my momma's in the kitchen, worrying now can he tell me about you 
 i don't know how to be alone. 
 
 [chorus:] 
 you're a distant memory 
 you're not sorry around 
 this year, to save me from tears 
 i was a dreamer before you went and let me know what you see 
 what a sad beautiful tragic love affair 
 
 we made quite a mess,
