 come on baby with me, mine is better 
 or said i need some time, need you now 
 
 [chorus:] 
 'cause it looks so much 
 and that's what i intend to do 
 i'm hopelessly devoted to you 
 
 but now there's nowhere to hide 
 since you pushed my love aside 
 i'm out of my baby 
 
 stay 
 hey, all you had to come back 
 there's a shortcut to the highway out of town that moves along 
 he's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition 
 i wonder if he knows he's all i think about at the sky 
 face all his voice in the mirror 
 he an honest word 
 but that was something i wished you got my coffee in the car 
 and you knew i could slow down time 
 taking pictures in my mind of being honest. 
 i'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here 
 don't let that speed limit slow you down 
 go out of the blue
