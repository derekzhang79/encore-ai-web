 the night when he says he will 
 it all the same, 
 another time and place 
 repeating history and i play and i wasnâ€™t half fast all again 
 in your mind 
 all that it's not a little 
 bigger than the rest 
 so i can picture 
 these simple words 
 a long time i played at your backdoor. 
 all this time how could you understand? 
 what do you say? 
 
 oh 
 i knew you were trouble when you walked in 
 trouble, trouble, trouble 
 i love you, and get you alone 
 your name 
 that never gets told 
 if for this all her life 
 that it slips right through your hair 
 absent-mindedly makin' me like i need you? 
 are you so far above me? 
 so i'm taking this thought was black and me 
 or say it's been a long 6 months 
 and you still catch my bed 
 
 before you think of me 
 and all you're ever gonna be is mean it, but tonight i called 'em all 
 later on you can expect some prank phone
