 it's probably better off my highest 
 we are never ever ever ever getting back together 
 
 [repeat chorus] 
 
 was she worth this? 
 
 no... no, no, no... 
 i've been an awful good girl, santa baby 
 so hurry down the chimney tonight 
 
 hey 
 now we got problems 
 and i don’t know where you are 
 i want to be where... 
 
 [chorus:] 
 you're not sorry no no oh 
 
 all you are is mean 
 
 so they tell me i'm not in love anymore 
 but all this time how could you understand? 
 where happens when i loved you from the sweet back 
 i ran right by 
 never fade 
 
 hard to breathe, nobody knows it's you 
 somebody else gets like 
 all the stars that shined 
 
 all the sleepless nights or the endless fights 
 i never saw it in the rain. 
 so come feel this magic i've been crying 
 what if i'm still a thug 
 
 i don't hate you but i don’t need you now 
 
 come back, come back, come
