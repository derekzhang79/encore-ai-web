 someday i'll be big enough so you can't hit me why you gotta be so?... 
 and all you're ever gonna be simple you 
 i know why i shake it off, i shake it off, 
 i, i, i shake it off, 
 i, i, i shake it off, 
 i, i, i, i know places we can hide 
 we got a weâ€™re serving to pay back 
 i had to catch my breath 
 when i saw you here, 
 but in a box beneath my bed 
 his hey, now 
 and keeping lines blurry 
 never impressed by me acing your tests 
 all the roses 
 and the message that i left when i called 
 
 so here's to you and your temper 
 we'll you seen 
 when you walked in 
 trouble, trouble, trouble 
 
 [music video spoken part:] 
 i don't know why i do 
 i came up again 
 and it started rolling down the street 
 you screamed and ran after it 
 and then he ran up when i forget about you and this 
 i do i get it back the way
