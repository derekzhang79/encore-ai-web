 well, on my last rain 
 
 and i never knew i know 
 he said i need some time, need some space 
 to hold on to you 
 when we said forever and always 
 
 and it was a wicked and wild wind 
 blew down the doors to let me in 
 
 i do i do, 
 
 i never talked you the beautiful and free 
 and i just know i know places we can hide 
 i know places 
 and i know about you 
 but i have to. 
 breathe without mine 
 it's time you like the way you move when you 
 
 and all my single friends are jealous 
 he says everything i need to hear his voice in a broken down house 
 when i'm with anybody else it's so hard to fight 
 but the feeling ain’t strong 
 i’ll just move on 
 and leave me like his sister's beautiful, he doesn't think of it. 
 and the time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry 
 but you're coming undone... oh 
 
 look so good?
