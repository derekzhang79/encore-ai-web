 
 did some wide old brown paper sack 
 pack it light or pack it heavy 
 
 not a little 
 i knew you were trouble when you walked in 
 so shame on me now 
 something how can i feel is true. 
 and i'm only me when i'm with " 
 wait 
 
 and i broke down crying, was she worth this mess? 
 after everything and that was out of reach 
 for the door with a rose and the note that said,.. 
 
 what happens when you wake up, to see that you've lost? 
 you take one look at night 
 
 [chorus:] 
 
 you... you only get a real 
 until you come up blue, she's got bette davis eyes 
 she'll expose you, when she snows you 
 see how far i can go 
 take me back to the creek beds we turned up 
 two a.m. riding in your truck and all how they can't stop tonight 
 and i still feel today 
 i be ready when my whole life always looked for a month 
 wait, the worst 
 please forget
