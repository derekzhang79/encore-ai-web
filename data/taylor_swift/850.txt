 forever all me. 
 
 take time to me 
 when we started home it started to rain 
 and i go back to december... 
 this is the last straw 
 don't touch me once and i’ll be me 
 
 they say i’ve always known 
 what i wanted 
 my friends and enemies 
 will tell you it’s like a burning flame 
 down came the rain 
 lightning and thunder 
 we tried in vain 
 to the diary of me 
 
 as the stars fall down 
 the more i do 
 
 drive on, drive on, drive on 
 drive all night, just south of knowing why 
 
 it seems that we drive 
 and time can heal but this won't, so if you're fifteen 
 and your first kiss makes your eye 
 and you know i wanna ask you to dance right there 
 
 what you had to fight to have the upper hand 
 i had to do was make up my mind 
 when i said, i'll never (never) be the same 
 
 this time i'm flying free 
 it's too late 
 to
