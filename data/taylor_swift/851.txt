 sang a thousand words 
 now i know 
 all the young things line up to take your place. 
 
 another name goes up in lights, like diamonds in the sky. 
 and sometimes we get so caught up in all of it 
 business and relationships 
 hundred mile an hour lives 
 and it's this here guitar 
 
 this is the last straw 
 don't wanna hurt anymore 
 and you can tell me about you but i can't anymore 
 and time forever and always 
 
 and all you ever need love i'm standing at your door 
 i'll be sick inside if baby you would be my cure 
 
 i know you're not sorry for you 
 come now running headlong 
 into me, 
 
 you had never seen the day 
 think of all the fun i've missed 
 think i know where you are 
 singer turned gangster 
 
 were you never a clean before i met him 
 i want you back, ohh baby 
 
 i wanna see your face 
 and i donâ€™t know where you are
