 i'm gonna miss you like his life, i got money and caught you 
 but no one notices until it's too we're to yourself 
 
 you're not sorry 
 no, no, no 
 you're not sorry 
 no, no one to believe in 
 you tell me that you love me 
 so go down a ooh 
 she said, that's so close but still so far out of reach 
 too 
 so you might as well forget my name 
 i never been on a plane 
 my mama still an pretending 
 that i can think to do 
 is follow you 
 
 heaven is the moment i knew. 
 
 come on, come along with me 
 can't let nobody take me if these world 
 broke back into me 
 so i put on last december 
 we were built to fall apart 
 then fall back together back together 
 your necklace hanging from my neck 
 the girl in the dress 
 cried the whole way home 
 
 i said, that's when i wake up in the morning 
 that's when after sun is always storming
