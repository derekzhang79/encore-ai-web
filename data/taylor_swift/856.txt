 and you're thinking we'll be fine again, 
 but not this time around 
 
 you had never come out of the blue 
 i wanna be your left hand man 
 i love you to the moon and back 
 
 i go to work, work all time 
 and all i go with you? 
 oh, daddy can i go with you? 
 oh, daddy can i go with you? 
 oh, daddy can i go with you? 
 oh, daddy can you love like that empty inside 
 
 oh don't fade away baby 
 blowing in the green grass, i saw the one we can't leave 
 but i believe in whatever you do 
 and iâ€™ll do anything to see it real slow 
 
 there you'll stand, ten feet tall 
 i will say, 
 i don't know about you, but you're coming undone 
 it's a roller coaster he month 
 there's gotta be more 
 the lights are home, 
 it feels like one of those nights, 
 we ditch the whole scene 
 it feels like one of those nights, 
 we ditch the whole scene 
 forever the way
