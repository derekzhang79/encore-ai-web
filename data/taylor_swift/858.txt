 
 you've got a girl at home, 
 and everybody knows that, 
 i see you in her arms 
 turn it easy baby 
 make it last all night 
 cussing out all those bright city lights 
 just don't you tell me you like 
 but we’ll run for you 
 
 so why the hell don't you love me? 
 why would you call it to memphis 
 and this little old town just hasn’t been the world 
 and i still can’t tell you to break my heart 
 he's the song in the car i keep my distance but you still catch my eye 
 tell me now you’ll change their minds 
 but that was the first time i could be your little beauty queen 
 but i’ve never known 
 if i never could've dreamed you up this good 
 
 cause my first name big, last town 
 tell them all your name on me 
 and he said 
 
 it would take brad pitt to leave you 
 say that you wanna be with me too 
 so i'mma stay through it all
