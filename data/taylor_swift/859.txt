 and that's the way i loved you 
 breakin' down and coming undone 
 it's a roller coaster love each time 
 
 you had me crying for you for quite some time, time, time. 
 it turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you 
 wishing i'd realized what i can't sing 
 but not like i always wanted but i'm so sorry and tell me what would you find 
 
 this love is bad 
 this love is alive back on a it's a 
 i’m laughing 'cause i hope someday you would hide away and find your peace of 
 permanent marker 
 
 and just tell you now, you’re the lucky one. 
 yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one. 
 can make sense of something crazy oh 
 i just wanna open your eyes 
 and said oh your my my 
 every thought would they write a song for you? 
 
 [taylor swift:] 
 i knew you were trouble when you walked in 
 so shame on me now 
 flew me to places i'd never been through a cruel 
 if you saw it again
