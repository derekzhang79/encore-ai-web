 
 hanging in my makeup again 
 tell myself i must be crazy, 
 thinking about him 
 
 it's something we all try to ignore 
 and put a wreath up on your door 
 
 and i saw 
 
 and they they find i'm even need in 
 when i said, i'm sorry " 
 and see it all now that you're gone. 
 don't you think that it's best 'cause we were happy 
 
 i could be your favorite blue jeans 
 when you play the fool 
 and all i wanna do believe in you 
 let's see if you believe in me 
 tell me 
 and tell me 
 why did you go away? 
 just a little outta reach 
 or the girl in a brand new dress, 
 in dreams running up 
 the front porch steps 
 after everything i need is to move around 
 
 it’s raining on sunday 
 there’s a walking tape recorder of everything you believe 
 and talking turned to screams. 
 
 oh 
 even like it's all you're mine 
 dreaming about you 
 just like a movie
