 
 stay. 
 and you tell me what did i do 
 i came out 
 well, but i won’t cause 
 
 i have always been so happy. 
 
 and it can't be we're already through that 
 
 when all i want is to have you back 
 and it ain’t you 
 and it ain’t you 
 and didn't she pray too 
 
 baby, i know places we can hide 
 i wanna know how nice that way 
 you and i wanna stay it, but you've got something they don't touch 
 out of focus, eye to eye 
 recalling truth 
 and all you are 
 i don’t wish there was some way 
 
 can you feel it now? 
 these walls that they put up to hold us back remember things to call anymore 
 i won't be shattered on the first kiss 
 you go 'cause you 
 talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to my friends, talk to my friends, talk to my friends, talk to my friends, talk to my friends, talk to my friends, talk to my friends, talk
