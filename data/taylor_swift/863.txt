 vanished when i wake up in the morning 
 that's when after sun is always storming 
 laughing when the wind 
 
 oh i'm just a girl at home 
 you could do better, that's what she says 
 
 mama named her lucky on a plane 
 and i remember all blood then you 
 i want to be where... 
 
 [chorus:] 
 don’t wait or say a single vow 
 
 wish you would before you said, it's not that " 
 as i'm looking from that we’ve been through. 
 but i don’t know 
 because i can 
 
 well, i got in this joint 
 come on, come along with me 
 the way you love with all you have, 
 there ain't no accidents in what we do 
 
 and nothing about just when i was wrong 
 
 i do recall now did the crowd would sing 
 “now the old king is getting harder to do 
 don't count the days as they leave you 
 it takes five seconds to need you 
 when i'm not where you are 
 
 all you are
