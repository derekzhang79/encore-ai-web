 a girl on a mission 
 but i'm so mad i might tell you that it's over 
 and just forget it was blue like of a while 
 try and stay out of everybody's way 
 it's your freshman year and i'll be yours 
 all i know 
 all the sleepless nights or the endless fights 
 i can’t stop thinking about you 
 i was born free 
 i’m a cell more brave and bright 
 and may all your christmases be white 
 
 i'm dreaming of a white christmas 
 just like the ones i used to know 
 so may all where are you? 
 so hurry down the chimney tonight 
 
 santa baby, a '54 convertible, too, light blue 
 and she scared me so bad and i try to dream my dreams above the concrete 
 store windows, traveled for miles 
 but something keeps me wishing on a wishing star 
 he's got her hopes up 
 got 'em up to there 
 wondering what to be somewhere where you are 
 it's a showdown (showdown) and that are is the 
 smokey black
