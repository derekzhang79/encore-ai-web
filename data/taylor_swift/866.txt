 you here i need reasons to figure me out 
 i always get it 
 i know what i want 
 and people would say, i show you how the crowds went wild 
 let's walk away 
 the past through 
 the smokey black nights 
 
 so here you are at my window 
 i go back to december all the same, 
 another time and never 
 he said he will try to take away the pain 
 and i start a little more brave 
 it's my turn to be me 
 
 it's been waiting for you 
 
 oh yeah, mandolin 
 
 got a long list of ex-lovers 
 they'll tell you i'm insane 
 but i've been crazy to a bit of you, 
 love like a burning all cold 
 
 and time stands still when you were mine 
 
 merry christmas everybody 
 she's got her hopes up 
 got 'em up to get around 
 that he found heaven on earth 
 
 i'm not a nice girl 
 
 [chorus:] 
 oh, oh i'm getting by with a broken heart you left me for her
