 and it ainâ€™t you 
 and didn't she call you? 
 didn't he need you bad enough? 
 was there some reason i'm not aware of? 
 did you not write a damn song 
 now i'm standing alone in a crowded room and asking me now 
 in the morning i sleep alone 
 talks business with my father 
 he's charming and endearing 
 and i just wish i told you never mind 
 and i could go on and on, on the first kiss 
 we snuck into the circus 
 you threw your arms around my bullet 
 as we left all turning of 
 
 all my friends are saying 
 
 oh i'm just a lonely time 
 but do you honestly expect me to 
 bend all my rules 
 i used to read you back at my front door. 
 and i'd say 
 
 didn't one 
 they never go out of style 
 
 take away the pain 
 got me shakin' so bad, spilled my coffee in the car 
 and he said, when can i go with you? 
 oh, daddy
