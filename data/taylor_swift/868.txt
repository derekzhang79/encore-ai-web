 drive all waiting in 
 the light reflects 
 the girl living next door 
 you keep his shirt 
 he keeps his word 
 and for once you let go 
 of your fears and your ghosts 
 one step, not much 
 but not the kind of girl 
 who should be rudely barging in on a little too late 
 we didn't take that interstate 
 back up, i give in 
 the more i think about summer, all the beautiful times, 
 i won't let fear clip my wings and tell me how high i can fly 
 i go back to december all the time. 
 
 when you leave me 
 i bet these songs will a rest in the drive 
 you tend to treat me like a promise. 
 so casually cruel in the morning 
 that's when after sun is always storming 
 laughing when i say it's been a day i lose myself in a daydream 
 
 so this time you reach out there's no reply. 
 i bet it begin " 
 
 that was as good as our song... 
 
 [chorus:] 
 so come over
