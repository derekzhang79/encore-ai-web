 will this here guitar 
 
 nice to scarf from your ghosts 
 one step, not much 
 but not the kind of girl 
 who should be rudely barging in on a scared little star 
 
 dear john, i see it all now 
 
 i like my windows down 
 so i best be here 
 for the cold came, the dark days 
 when fear crept into my mind 
 you gave me out 
 something's gone terribly wrong 
 but all it was supposed to be with me and you 
 
 and you donâ€™t even know you, 
 she's been on the verge of 
 running around in circles 
 baby all i want is you 
 
 and all i really wanna do is be next to me 
 as the sweet life 
 don't you come back to what you need 
 
 for all those wishes on planes 
 we thought were stars 
 memories like photographs 
 oh baby,here we are 
 this here guitar 
 
 all you are is not where you've been. 
 you're still an innocent. 
 that don't do something for me 
 the
