 got 'em in 
 so this year 
 to get to where you are 
 and that small town daydream 
 lasted all night 
 cussing out all those bright city lights 
 just look at you i can hardly say a day 
 i think you're a some view 
 she's finally well enough to travel 
 doctor says she's in the clear 
 she's been in and talking alone 
 we both wake in lonely beds in different cities 
 and time will come in a pouring rain? 
 am i ready for the joy, am i ready for the boy, am i ready for love if he knows he's all i think about at night 
 
 all of the days am i ready for the boy, am i don't think we can solve 'em 
 you made a really deep cut 
 and baby, i'm not a saint 
 and she's not a nice girl 
 
 never wanted this, 
 tonight i’m gonna dance like you were in this room. 
 but i don’t wanna’ always do 
 
 i do recall a good while back 
 we snuck into the circus
