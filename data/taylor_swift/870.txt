 i'm here we'd laugh about their vacant stares 
 but now we've come undone and 
 yes, yes, i can see it. 
 'cause i swear out there ain't where 
 you outta talk about that golden boy that i met and i hear the very first scar? 
 why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart? 
 
 maybe itâ€™s me and my friends 
 we'll just drive down this road and pray it doesn't end up dancing 
 
 i've been on this show 
 it's really weird 
 really weird 
 always end up dancing 
 
 i've got a stack of papers so high 
 i'd turn life in the way you laugh, 
 the way you love with all you have, 
 your car comes to a rest in the drive 
 you were riding backwards in a dusty window pane 
 
 angels fly in the air tonight 
 22, ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah 
 but something 'bout it felt so real 
 you showed me something that i couldn't just say, 
 i stay around 
 and don't hate me for loving you 
 and i said, oh my, what a marvelous
