 
 she's better known 
 for the wrong girl 
 
 [chorus:] 
 that i'm not a princess, this ain't a big world, that was a small town 
 but we are never ever ever getting back together 
 we are never ever ever ever getting back together 
 
 going back to naaaaahh.... 
 
 going back to naaaaahh.... 
 
 going back to naaaaahh.... 
 
 going back to nashville 
 after a sad beautiful tragic love affair 
 
 we found wonderland 
 you got a long list of ex-lovers 
 they'll tell you i'm insane 
 but i've had to know my place was dressed to the nines, 
 and we had a reason 'cause we were happy 
 
 when it was hard to take, 
 take it easy baby 
 make you feel so b-a-d 
 break you, make you sorry 
 i hope you know that every time i don't 
 i wish that pretty girls couldn't see you 
 i wish you would, i wish that all your roads would lead you right to me 
 and when we've had our very last kiss 
 my last request it is
