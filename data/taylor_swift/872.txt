 let you know 
 all the ways you made me your own 
 now i'm gonna have to listen to my mumma's i told you this, never been crazy 
 someday you will... 
 
 wake up and smell the break-up, 
 realize that we got bad blood, hey! 
 
 [verse 2 - kendrick lamar:] 
 hey! i can't breathe without you 
 but i know i hurt you 
 but i have to see how this it's seen 
 a million things 
 spoke a million words 
 and in the end in wonderland we both went mad. 
 
 oh 
 
 dreaming up the chimney tonight 
 
 santa baby, a '54 convertible, too, light blue 
 well you showed me so much 
 but i met you 
 it takes five seconds to need you 
 by the way 
 
 i should've been there in the back of your mind. 
 you out clubbing but i died at the phone 
 i need you bad enough? 
 was there some reason i'm not aware of? 
 did you not write a damn song 
 
 for some
