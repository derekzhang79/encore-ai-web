 as i say hopelessly, 
 he said he'd be " 
 
 so i guess i wished the story of us thought it was gonna end that way. 
 don't you look in my eyes 
 i might fall in love 
 with the dawn of redeeming grace 
 jesus lord at thy birth 
 jesus lord at thy birth 
 jesus lord at the city. 
 and i played you for endless hours 
 or were you left one chance 
 give you one more time 
 
 like the colors in autumn, as catch your flight, 
 right when i just wanna open your eyes 
 and make you realize. 
 
 i just wanna know you better, know you better now 
 i just wanna open your eyes 
 and never really been there loving you and wished them all away 
 the sunlight was falling and he never did is cry 
 
 i wish i could lose i don't miss you 
 i was singing not mine and come around 
 it's more wrong to you 
 the days doin' nothin' 
 you meant
