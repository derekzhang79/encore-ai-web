 there's something they don't touch 
 you go to go that far. 
 and i, are you go 
 i see you turn off your phone, 
 and now you say, 
 i like it 
 
 were you just seen it before 
 i told myself, don't get " 
 i can see that you're angry 
 by the way 
 if the high was worth all that, but he never does. 
 i remember your laugh 
 i don't know why all the trees change in weather and turn and brought up that 
 
 could you tell me what you gave to me 
 my daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be in another town 
 and i got that red lip classic thing they can't find out 
 i found you 
 and there was something wrong, it was all my fault 
 i had it all, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day 
 
 made up you 
 
 wasn't it you that told me? 
 the sun would always chase the day 
 and it all comes out 
 and not remember that you can't live
