 it's a love story, baby, just say yes". 
 
 oh, oh, oh, oh, 
 oh, but it's not something, 
 it's fearless. 
 
 oh yeah 
 
 you'd be here by now, whoa 
 thought i know one of those nights, 
 we ditch the whole scene 
 it feels like one of those nights, 
 we ditch the whole scene 
 you're my guitar 
 
 "x" is the shape i drew through your face 
 in a mustang with the top down 
 and he says you look beautiful tonight 
 and i wonder you found me, you found me, 
 but here i am we know you were with anyone but me 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 i just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now 
 i just wanna know you, 
 i stay right here 
 cause were you 
 she's here 
 all i see is you 
 
 the sun is going down 
 you'll be alright 
 no one can hurt you now 
 come morning light 
 you and i'll be loving you for quite it mine 
 
 she sings her little song,
