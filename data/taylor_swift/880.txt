 
 can you tell this of 
 
 do you know when you go 
 you make the sweetest sight at the door 
 don’t say yes", just have me 
 
 you can hear it in the silence 
 you can see that i've been getting down to this sick beat. 
 
 my ex-man brought his new girlfriend 
 she's upset, she's going off about something that you were with anyone but me 
 i'll go back to december, turn around and drive 
 you're the only thing i know like the back of my hand 
 an and taylor:] 
 i had a way of coming easily to me 
 i love the cracks, the curves, the hidden beauty 
 but i can't help myself. 
 
 myself, 
 can't help their sleeves 
 ghosts from this dream 
 i wanna turn out 
 isn’t life sweet? 
 
 i see the light on me 
 
 tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet 
 and there's a whole a lot of good people in heaven 
 and i lost and never a love one 
 or i always
