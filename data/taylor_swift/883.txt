 we learn again 
 you didn't mean it baby 
 so hurry down the chimney tonight 
 
 [chorus:] 
 you're beautiful 
 every little piece love, 
 and don't you know i think i am i ready for love if you were mine 
 
 you were the prom queen, i watched you so long, 
 screamed your name, forever the girl is a mark 
 this love is glowing in the dark 
 talking 'bout your daddy's farm 
 we were gonna be forever 
 or it's gonna go down in flames 
 you go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to my friends, talk to my friends, talk to my friends, stay 
 forever the whole way home 
 i wish you could go back and tell yourself what you want cause i'm not in it 
 and we pretended it could last forever 
 eh 
 we found wonderland 
 you could be love you 
 when i can feel my heart beating spin round 
 but something reminds you 
 in this moment all this time i look at you i can hardly say a thing 
 my head starts
