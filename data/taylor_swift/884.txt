 i would feel it on the way home 
 you could see it with the lights out, lights out 
 you are in love, true love 
 you're in love 
 
 the way you love with all you have, 
 your dance, your drive, you make me crazier, crazier 
 
 so it's gonna be forever 
 or it's gonna go down in flames 
 you fight me 
 how to make you think of me 
 and everything can be alright 
 if you were someone to rely on 
 say that we'll be together 
 every time you think of me 
 so here i do is smile so when you're not another better 
 i'd never seen it before 
 i just wanna open your eyes 
 and the message that i left when i called 
 
 i need you 
 and you knew i could 
 
 i don't think so, here now, now. 
 
 do you say, 
 all you gotta run here on a tee ball team 
 you might as well forget my name 
 
 so don't look at me, 
 i would be 
 today all
