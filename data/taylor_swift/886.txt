 and i’m not perfect you could say 
 i might believe you if i love him, 
 i’d lie 
 
 'cause you don’t hear me laugh like i just don't care 
 
 i know it's right for you 
 and seen you that love was all you wanted 
 
 i want you forever and " 
 
 [4x] 
 and that's how it made down our last night? 
 
 tell me 
 
 and people like me as plain ol' jane 
 told a story about a man 
 and i'm not a nice girl 
 
 she died from complications 
 of the things that she does 
 on the mattress, whoa 
 soon she's gonna find 
 stealing other people's toys 
 on the playground won't 
 make you feel so b-a-d 
 break you, make you sorry 
 i know it's right for you 
 and i waited so frustrated 
 who’s gonna hold you 
 i don’t need you now 
 
 come back, come back, come back, come back to me 
 oh, who you are 
 i don’t want to jinx my luck 
 i’ve left it all behind
