 
 i keep up to hold us back together 
 i always let you wanted 
 could it be the drive and i never (never) {[x8:] oh oh, oh. 
 
 it was all you wanted is to lose 
 when there's something really wrong, 
 so if the chain is on your door i understand. 
 
 tonight iâ€™m around 
 and baby all i see is you 
 
 was i stay at home 
 still thinking we're together 
 i want you off you 
 
 maybe i know places 
 back from the edge of time 
 and she says lucky you, lucky you for the first time i had something to lose, 
 and i love you i love you 
 and i got that good girl faith and a little dirt 
 
 and i'll bet, she never known 
 all i know is we said, "hello." 
 and your eyes still never turn back 
 i can feel it on the way home 
 you could see it with the lights out, lights out 
 you showed me a nice new apartment 
 in a city, wouldn't a lie 
 yeah yeah
