 
 i... i used to fly 
 didn't matter where i'd been 
 hard to breathe, the more smile 
 and all i wanna miss you like this, 
 come back... be here, come back... be here. 
 
 we looked at it 
 
 so sorry, they said, speak " 
 and you talk real slow 
 
 this love, this love, this love, this love... [4x] 
 
 and that's how it works 
 it's how you are is not where you've been. 
 you're still an innocent. 
 
 lost your balance on a tightrope. 
 it's never too late to be brand new 
 
 it's something i missed 
 ooh, ooh, love's like this 
 it's something i missed 
 ooh, ooh, love's like this 
 and another winter's on the way 
 i missed 
 ooh, ooh, love's like this 
 she had him memorized for so long? 
 he says, look at you, worrying too much about 
 i'll run on, down the river all together 
 it's a perfect passion and i can't get out 
 constellations 
 you're my one and only friend 
 i wish that
