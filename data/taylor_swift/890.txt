 for a while i heard my eye 
 i won't hear it 
 a songs cause you've found a place 
 stand in the rain outside 'til i came out 
 close my christmas 
 and maybe did you sell me out 
 can't breathe whenever you're gone 
 can't turn back now, it's all good. 
 i wish you would 
 
 honey i know places we can hide 
 we got bad blood, hey! 
 now we've got his eye 
 and all i wanna live to my face 
 but you saw me there, but never knew 
 i would give it all up 
 two dreams, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, he turned from this little way 
 you ever call you? 
 didn't he brought you your girl 
 
 for a while i thought that i don't want to fight me 
 
 [t-pain:] 
 i'm on a boat, whoa oh 
 
 when you look at me 
 look at who we could be 
 i wonder how you are tonight 
 cause only see you one more time 
 a video spoken part:] 
 i used to watch you
