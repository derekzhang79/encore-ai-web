 i'd be breaking all my rules to see you 
 in your room and our slates are clean 
 just twin fire signs 
 four blue and grey? 
 and i just wanna open your eyes 
 trying to make its way to be 
 the highlight of my day 
 i'm taking pictures in my mind 
 both me and my baby 
 the car pulls up and i'm home 
 about the whole thing 
 guess you gotta run sometimes 
 maybe i'm a feeling you wrong 
 at least then i thought would never leave me 
 
 bye, bye, to everything i thought was on my side 
 bye, bye, to everything you are 
 where i really wish i could run to you. 
 and i could be your little beauty queen 
 just a small town boy and girl 
 for me and my baby 
 the best people in life are free 
 
 and it would take brad pitt to leave you 
 it takes five seconds to need you 
 when i'm looking back at you 
 remember when you proved mine 
 
 before you
