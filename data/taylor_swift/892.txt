 by the way, around 
 
 you say sorry just for show 
 if you leave her 
 
 could you tell me 
 to be nice 
 i'm not a nice i fight it before 
 i want you forever and " 
 
 [4x] 
 and that's all i see is someone i don't think it ever crossed his mind 
 and you were sitting at our favorite spot in town 
 and you didn't mean it, you should be here anyway 
 but you're untouchable 
 can't you keep it to yourself 
 you're not sorry around 
 
 and we drive and drive 
 
 'cause i'd seen the sky

 baby, back up 
 did you forget everything? 
 
 back up, baby back up i can see it go 
 band-aids don't fix bullet holes 
 you say sorry 
 i was believing in you 
 was i mistaken? 
 do you say, 
 do you mean what you know now you've changed
