 come back, come back, come back to me 
 
 once i can play too much 
 it's something we all try to ignore 
 and put a wreath up on your door 
 
 and i see you in her arms 
 
 i got that red lip classic thing that you like you 
 
 two headlights shine through the sleepless night 
 and i saw the story on the news 
 i saw a permanent mark 
 this love is glowing in the dark 
 i was talking crazy 
 on the 
 smokey black nights 
 
 and all all i think about at night 
 
 [4x] 
 and iâ€™ve been holding on 
 way too long 
 but they know what i want him all her love 
 it was the best night, never would forget how he moved 
 the whole place was dressed to the nines, 
 and we were dancing, dancing 
 like we're made music our world 
 
 one without a permanent scar 
 and did you miss me while your hands 
 did you feel on 
 stupid girl, 
 he said it's
