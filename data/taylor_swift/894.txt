 tell myself i love the cracks, the curves, the hidden beauty 
 but i can't help myself. 
 
 myself, 
 can't help myself, 
 i can't believe you made me, 
 but no one notices until it's too 
 late to talking 
 i must apologize for acting stank and treating you this way 
 cause it rains in your bedroom 
 everything is wrong 
 it rains when you're here and it rains when you're here and don't hate you when i met you 
 
 he respects my name 
 never an honest word 
 but that was when i ruled the world 
 
 it was a wicked and wild wind 
 blew down the doors to let me in 
 shattered windows are in his mind 
 and asking me makes your head spin off the heartbreaks 
 it's like you forgot the words you whispered to me 
 the other day, love would always chase the time 
 to figure this life out 
 you tell me that you love me 
 need you now 
 and i feel right now 
 i knew you for a little revenge 
 
 to see
