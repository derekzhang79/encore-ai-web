 you should've burst through the door, 
 just like all those times before, 
 you say it now? 
 these walls that they could be 
 you say, this crazy world's come undone 
 
 summer's over and leaves begin to fall 
 and another winter's on the way 
 i love your handshake, meeting my father 
 i wanna tell you why 
 but somehow i know 
 
 [chorus:] 
 the simple things in life are got bette davis eyes 
 she'll turn the music on you, you loved me 
 when we started home it started to rain 
 you put your eyes on me 
 forever and ever here 
 come on baby 
 
 i let you in the door, 
 but you're just so cool 
 run your hands through your hair 
 absent-mindedly makin' me like a promise. 
 so polished that it slips right through your hands 
 
 and that was the first day. 
 
 and darling, it was good never looking down. 
 and i'll go sit on the floor 
 cried into my bed 
 with a run through the night light 
 thought you love em,
