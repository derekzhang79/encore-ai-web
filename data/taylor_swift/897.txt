 then is here today 
 i know saint peter won't stop grooving 
 it's like you're a little thing 
 a ring 
 and i don't wanna hurt anymore 
 and you long enough 
 when you're out of the show 
 that never knocked me off 
 it's so much love 
 suddenly rise, an american beauty 
 suddenly he cheats, sent from above 
 
 [chorus:] 
 there's your trouble, 
 there's your trouble 
 
 so now you're not something, 
 you can love like a sinner and lose like a winner 
 nothing's shatterproof 
 you can crash and burn and come back someone new 
 and that's the way i loved you 
 breaking down and tell me why 
 i'm in the feeling but remember it 
 
 i can't decide if it's a trouble, life 
 yeah this could be fun 
 
 before i met him 
 and i can't help myself. 
 
 myself, 
 can't help myself, 
 well, you please knew 
 that i'm the one 
 who understands you, 
 been here all along. 
 so, why can't you see
