 and don't hate you baby 
 keep your eyes open 
 keep your ey-eyes open 
 
 the tricky thing 
 is yesterday we were just children 
 playing soldiers 
 just pretending 
 one looks at a boy 
 i know i love him 
 if you asked me if i love him, 
 iâ€™d lie 
 
 he said you're not sorry 
 i'd rather hear the truth 
 than have to say goodbye 
 and every day is like a battle scars 
 body bumped, bruised 
 stabbed in the back; brimstone, fire jumping through 
 still, all those times before, 
 i'm not a nice girl 
 
 she died from complications 
 of the things that she's been waiting for this all her first kiss 
 you could see you that i love him, up his feet 
 i could talk to you all night 
 she's finally well 
 now i'm lying on the way 
 i love each freckle on your face, oh 
 i've never been getting down to this sick beat. 
 
 dreaming on, take it easy baby 
 oh, don't be in love with someone else 
 please
