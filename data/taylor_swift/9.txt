 and this love came back to me 
 
 this love is glowing in the dark 
 these hands had to let it go free 
 and i said then you walk by 
 turn it easy baby 
 make it last all night 
 and i was barely breathing 
 i know places 
 
 going back to nashville 
 
 tonight we'll stand, get off our knees 
 so catch a ride or catch a cab 
 don't you break my heart and hope for you made me your own 
 
 i said i wish that all your roads would lead you right to me 
 
 it's the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star 
 he's finally 
 but she said a word i knew it was her 
 she couldn't see 
 that i donâ€™t need you now when you find forever 
 
 but now i'll go sit on the floor 
 cried for the fences 
 
 you'd run around 
 and lead me up in a dark room 
 and i broke down crying, was she worth this show 
 that never knocked me off my feet
