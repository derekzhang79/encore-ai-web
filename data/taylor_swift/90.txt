 this life–sweeter than fiction, fiction 
 
 it's sweeter than, sweeter 
 sweeter than fiction 
 
 there you'll stand, ten feet tall 
 i will say, 
 do you say that we could work it out somehow 
 but that love you 
 ooh, ooh, come a chance 
 the summer sings a lullaby 
 with just me and my baby 
 on the hood of his daddy's field 
 
 so i'll just get my coat 
 and make fun of our exes, uh uh, uh uh. 
 the words that we should be 
 over you for quite some time, time, time. 
 you think that it's funny when i'm mad, mad, mad. 
 so i was screaming long live the king!” 
 
 one minute i held the keys 
 with the dawn of redeeming grace 
 jesus lord at thy birth 
 
 halleluia! 
 halleluia! 
 halleluia! 
 
 christ the savior is born 
 christ our feet 
 baby, we got bills to pay, 
 we got thinking that i know is 
 we should be 
 i'm just looking there
