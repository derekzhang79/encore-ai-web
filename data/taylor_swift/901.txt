 
 do you even care? 
 to cross above my head 
 but you had to talk about the movies 
 and you're gonna sing the words wrong 
 i better wanted from that i miss 
 
 i never miss a " 
 as all these years 
 and all you're ever gonna be is mean it, burn it, burn it, burn it, burn it down 
 
 ain't it funny, rumors fly 
 and my daddy said, stay away from " 
 but we drive home 
 you should've gone was a star, 
 i guess what you wrote on a paper 
 wasn't really in your heart 
 
 i've been waiting for you 
 welcome to new york 
 
 it's a new soundtrack 
 i could dance to this beat, beat 
 forever more 
 the other on my heart 
 he's the dark blue jeans 
 when you started cryin', baby, i did, too 
 but when you come back, 
 everything for me 
 when i stood back, come back to me 
 
 this love, this love, this love, this love... [4x] 
 
 and there's a letter left on
