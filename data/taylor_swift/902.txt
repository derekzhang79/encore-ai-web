 i know you're saying that you'll be here anyway 
 but you're untouchable 
 burning brighter than the sun 
 can't stop, won't stop grooving 
 it's like we could work it out somehow 
 but that i don't touch 
 out of focus, eye to eye 
 recalling words we said 
 the battle that we swore 
 we'd never fight 
 breaking pieces off with the pain 
 guess i loved you way 
 just look in the name of you, 
 i think i am finally clean 
 i think i am finally clean 
 
 there was one thing 
 and for for you 
 so here that i miss you too much to be mad anymore 
 oh, oh, oh, oh, 
 oh, oh, daddy said, i met you i knew 
 that i'm the one 
 who understands you, 
 i know i'm laughing on the feet 
 she didn't even swear 
 hello? ugh! fire 
 a girl on a silver plate 
 just a puppet up in flames 
 there was a beautiful magic love there 
 what a marvelous tune 
 it was the best night,
