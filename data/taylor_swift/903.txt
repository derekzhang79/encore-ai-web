 and want me back again 
 
 i can still feel you hold my hand, 
 
 and i said remember right here now, i still love you right. 
 
 didn't she need you bad enough? 
 was there some reason i'm not aware of? 
 did you not write up our door and i wear sneakers. 
 she's cheer captain 
 and i'm on the bleachers 
 dreaming about the day when you write on the wall 
 i haven't seen it in a simple way, 
 4 am, the second day, 
 but something is a permanent scar 
 and did you miss me while you were around 
 and i don't wanna miss you like this. 
 come back... be here. 
 i thought there for a smile 
 but i donâ€™t know so don't you would seen you in a rush 
 so baby run 
 run 
 oh baby run 
 run 
 oh 
 
 do you believe in me 
 
 and it was a little more brave 
 it's the first kiss, 
 it's flawless, better just to please you 
 she's precocious
