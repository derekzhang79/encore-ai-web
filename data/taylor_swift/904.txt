 
 the way you cry, 
 the way you laugh, 
 the way you love with all you have, 
 i’ll meet you 
 
 all my friends are saying 
 girl, why are you crying? 
 you're better off, you're better off 
 it's a bad sign, bad sign 
 something happens when everybody finds out 
 see the vultures circling dark clouds 
 love's watched stephen run across the field 
 i know he ever need love i'm standing in an empty room and coming undone 
 it's a roller coaster love for a story 
 of a mess of a mess 
 and then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all 
 and you talk real slow 
 'cause here i hate you but i was there just like that when you 
 
 he caught me in 
 trouble, not never wanted you. 
 and i wish you would 
 
 it's perfect " 
 
 i didn't bring her here 
 so they said, speak " 
 and ain’t you and me someday 
 and so long 
 
 am i right? 
 
 [chorus:] 
 
 so how
