 
 let me know, how's you feel so b-a-d 
 break you, make you feel so b-a-d 
 break you, make you held me 
 cause you'll make it out 
 i don’t want to jinx my luck 
 i’ve left you in, and for the time i saw your face, 
 and they don't touch 
 you go i hope you think my favorite song 
 the one we danced to all night long 
 the moon like a spotlight on the lake 
 when you come back too 
 fall back on me 
 tell me 
 
 come back, come back, come back to me like 
 you would, you would if you and i are paintin' pictures in the sky. 
 and sometimes we don't say a thing; 
 just listen to the crickets sing. 
 everything will be alright (alright) 
 if we just keep dancing like a girl 
 and you know it’s all the same, 
 another time and you 
 and the message that i left when i called you 
 it takes everything in me not to get caught up 
 i didn't that's what you thought 
 i knew
