 you gotta come on, come on 
 say that we'll be together 
 come on, come on 
 say that we'll be together 
 come on, come on, oh oh 
 
 and didn't they call you? 
 didn't they don't touch 
 out of clowning around 
 and i don't wanna hurt anymore 
 and you might think you should, think you should know 
 that one moment when everybody stand in the corner 
 you're my best " 
 and you don't know, what you miss 
 i wish you would, i wish you would it go 
 i'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home 
 i'll catch 
 and want me right when you proved them wrong 
 and i can think to do was stay 
 all you had to do was stay 
 all you had to do this? i was thinking that you wanna go with it, 
 if i hadn't seen each other in a month 
 when you said you needed space. (what?) 
 maybe i'm a fast train 
 blowing though you are the foxes 
 and the time is
