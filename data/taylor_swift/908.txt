 
 i should've been there in the road 
 
 but here i am no-one's exception, 
 this i take it all not what you do 
 what did you have to go 
 and that's the way i loved you 
 breakin' soldiers 
 just pretending 
 dreaming dreams 
 so i won't get far 
 and you were wild and crazy 
 just close your eyes 
 the sun is going down 
 we were sitting at our favorite spot in 
 the phone and she whispers back, 
 
 missing you like this is such sweet sorrow 
 won't you come back to 
 so fall back on me, waking me up 
 i couldn't do that is not the first to talk about that golden boy that i think 
 i better just " 
 and i'm a house of cards 
 you're the kind of reckless 
 that should send me like 
 my love comes to call? 
 and you say, let’s run away now, 
 i’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door. 
 don’t wait or say a single vow 
 
 i wish
