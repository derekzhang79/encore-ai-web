 
 oh 
 
 think of all the girls tossing rocks at your window 
 i'm just sitting here 
 baby, are everything to me. 
 
 baby, i know places we said, "hello." 
 when we're on the phone and without a warning 
 i try to dream my dreams 
 so there's so much that i can't say "hello" to you 
 and i don’t knew this time that " 
 i'll be here, today and here tomorrow 
 in dark blue tennessee 
 
 and it was all a little one 
 
 and you don't know, tonight 
 
 let's talk about me and you open your eyes 
 and put me 'bout your long 
 say that i'm not where you are 
 i don’t need you now 
 
 let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one. 
 let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one. 
 and they’ll tell you now, you're not sorry 
 as you said look by the ground 
 when you saw me there, but never knew 
 i was barely breathing 
 i can only love you
