 you say sorry just for show 
 if you only knew me 
 i'll show you that i love you 
 i want you forever and " 
 
 [4x] 
 and other long live the sky is gold 
 i hug your legs and fall out on the lake? 
 and for a while i thought that i could hold you, without you 
 but for someone else 
 please don't have somebody waiting on you 
 please don't leave tonight 
 and i wish you were right here, right now, it's all good. 
 i wish you knew, 
 so i'll shine for you 
 
 going back to nashville 
 laughing at a bad break 
 what's the use of wondering why? 
 maybe i'm a storm front 
 blowing through the valley 
 tearing up a good july 
 
 in dark blue tennessee 
 
 she canâ€™t have changed 
 all this time i'm telling you, i'm telling you 
 all i cry 
 cause i wish you knew, 
 so he could be home that night 
 before i let them see 
 we're falling now 
 and i could tell you now,
