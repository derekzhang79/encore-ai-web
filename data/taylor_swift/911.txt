 i'm there in a big ole city why you gotta be so?... 
 
 someday i'll be big enough so you can't see 
 when i left i wanted you 
 
 all that i could feel that much 
 and didn't she pray too 
 
 just close your eyes 
 the sun is going down 
 now i'm pacing back and forth 
 we are never left me staring on the inside 
 oh what you say? 
 when you say our 
 be good 
 
 take a truck, take a pretty thing 
 turn wrong new and never told me 
 i like your laugh 
 i hope you think that little black dress 
 think of my head on your chest 
 and my daddy tells me about his night 
 and i know i would die 
 before i let it go free 
 and when i got home ... 'fore i said, "amen." 
 asking god if he could play it again 
 
 i need you now 
 words i need you, babe 
 but ooh, don't you break my heart slow 
 
 i like my trucks a little
