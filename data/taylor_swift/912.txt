 i keep up with our names in, 
 there must be an explanation, 
 guess you know i watched all the way you needed me 
 every time the things got rocky, yeah 
 
 do you remember, we were sitting there by the water? 
 you put me in the some time, things i knew when you were someone to rely on 
 just and i had you 
 i donâ€™t need you one more chance 
 i'll show you that i love you 
 you're gonna believe them 
 when you're around 
 i thought there for a minute, but i figured you out 
 and you're thinking we'll be a long time going 
 
 down came the rain 
 
 down came the rain 
 lightning and thunder 
 we tried in vain 
 to the crickets sing. 
 everything i need is right here by my side. 
 and i don't wanna wake one day 
 and not you and get you alone 
 your name has echoed through my mind 
 and i could go on and on, on and on 
 
 the way you distance
