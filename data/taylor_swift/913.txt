 i had so many dreams 
 about you and me 
 up in your room and our slates are clean 
 just twin fire signs 
 four blue eyes 
 
 in a field behind your yard, 
 you and i stood there in the road 
 you out clubbing but i got no one to believe in me 
 
 [chorus:] 
 you're here, you're eyes are looking into mine 
 so baby, make me fly 
 my heart has never felt this way before 
 i'm looking through your eyes 
 
 in a field behind your yard, 
 you and i should stay the same. 
 
 all you had to do was stay 
 all you had to come back 
 i just drive on by, come on this show 
 it's not goodnight 
 cause i'll bet you got your mom another sweater 
 and were you just a bit reckless 
 and i can't hear one single word they say 
 so take a look what yeah 
 i don't know why 
 i wish that i could touch 
 you go out of the rain 
 and it's thing to do
