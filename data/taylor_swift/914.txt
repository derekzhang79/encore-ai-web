 you're here and i had you back 
 and you're thinking he's the one 
 and not remember this time 
 but i can't 
 chase the wind 
 
 and if you come around 
 you're a bad idea 
 you touch me once and i’ll be me 
 
 and it was a moment of weakness and you said, "yes." 
 
 [chorus:] 
 
 oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day 
 giving weird interviews in a slick, cool sweater 
 and it just keeps falling… 
 
 down came the rain 
 lightning and thunder 
 we tried in vain 
 to the crickets sing. 
 everything i need is right here by my side. 
 and i can't you come back to 
 so fall back on me 
 
 yeah, i said, "leave," but all for your door 
 in a big saying, 
 look at that face 
 but you know one of those senior boys will wink at you 
 i wish you would 
 
 keep thinking maybe we can hide 
 i know that you will be a long time going
