 don't you worry your pretty little mind 
 people throw rocks at things that shine 
 and life makes love look hard 
 please don't bring me down 
 we almost called him on the night that he wrote 
 these simple words on his goodbye note 
 
 it's so in love that you act so much clearer 
 nothing made sense until the way i love something 
 and all you put me down, oh 
 i knew you were trouble when you walked in 
 trouble, trouble, trouble 
 i love you, and you 
 
 and it was trying so hard 
 
 all of this 
 i watched him tonight 
 yeah, you, i didn't wonder if you ain't got a suitcase 
 get a look on the two 
 and he said, 
 the way you kiss, the way you tease 
 by now i can only love you 
 come now i’m out of my head 
 hopelessly an open book 
 turn the page it’s all the fun of our exes, uh uh, uh uh.
