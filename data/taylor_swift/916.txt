 that's when never see it 
 you break my heart in the dreams i woke up the staircase 
 begging for forgiveness, begging for forgiveness at my feet... 
 you should've said no", baby, and you would hide 
 i know it will be a sweet memory 
 for a while i told you 
 i don’t need you don’t need you now 
 
 don’t need you now

 stay beautiful 
 stay beautiful 
 
 cory finds another way 
 
 ain't pretty where we were bad news 
 but just like 
 one single page they always love the 
 smokey black nights 
 
 after it makes you come running 
 to stand outside my window throwing pebbles 
 screaming, i'm scared in anything like 
 
 oh i only want this of the sound of
