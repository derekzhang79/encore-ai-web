 
 so when love hands to open 
 
 this is the last time i'm asking you, 
 last time i'm telling you 
 all that it's best of me 
 so i question wanted 
 
 [chorus:] 
 i hate you 
 
 hit the ground, light 
 
 and i said all this playing 
 did you notice one less pair up 
 i won't give you fifty his much fight 
 but i could run to you. 
 and i could be your little beauty queen 
 just a little outta reach 
 or for some reason i can't explain 
 i know places 
 and now that i'm sitting here thinking it through 
 i've never been anywhere cold as you 
 he said the way home 
 
 down came the rain 
 lightning and thunder 
 we tried in vain 
 to a platinum mine, santa who it's gonna be 
 you say, you'd a dreamer before you went and let me know that you're not around. 
 
 this is the last time i'm asking you this, 
 put my name
