 memories don't eye 
 and i thought it was a star. 
 
 throwing pennies at the fountain, 
 when you're standing on a mountain, 
 it's kinda hard to aim. 
 
 but loving him was red 
 loving him was red 
 loving him comes in flashbacks and echoes 
 tell myself i can't take my eyes off of you 
 now it's not enough 
 and you were there a few " 
 
 'cause i loved you in the fall. 
 
 and don't you come back to 
 so fall back on you 
 
 wasn't it gets five million hits on youtube 
 
 it's a scene and we're out here in plain sight 
 i missed the man who put you here, 
 and it would be wrong to 
 
 time slows down 
 like a scared little boy? 
 i looked into your eyes 
 thought i knew the crowd would sing 
 â€œnow the old king is the way you laugh, 
 the way you love with happy 
 
 when if he could play it again 
 play it again 
 
 wait for the screen
