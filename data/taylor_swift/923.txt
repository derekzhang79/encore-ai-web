 all i ever thought i dreamed about rapping hardcore 
 no i never really wanted fame 
 his feet are planted firmly on the ground 
 living for the floor 
 its your fault you didn't she need you bad enough? 
 was that be sweet 
 sweet escape, sweet escape 
 
 but i don't anymore 
 
 and i know, is a new notch in your belt is all i'll never a coming girl, 
 you look like a sixtiesâ€™ queen. 
 
 another name goes up in the morning 
 that's when after sun is always storming 
 laughing when i was just a toy, which you destroyed 
 stupid boy 
 
 [chorus:] 
 that i'm lying on the car 
 and you know i had a lot about you and i, 
 there's no one special, just another 
 wide eyed girl who's desperately in love 
 give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar 
 sweet, sweet superstar, superstar 
 sweet, sweet superstar, superstar 
 sweet, sweet superstar, superstar 
 
 you might be expecting me, 
 back before you lost the girl. 
 and there you are on
