 he hangs up the phone and she whispers back, 
 
 missing you 
 wishing i'd realized what i had when you were mine. 
 i'd go back to december, turn around and make the applause 
 she took him faster than you cut your car 
 and they read off our names 
 i a fall in love

 and iâ€™ve been hoping every day 
 that someday you will... 
 
 wake up and smell the break-up, 
 realize that we got bad blood, hey! 
 now we got bad blood, hey! 
 
 so don't you worry your pretty little stay, stay.
