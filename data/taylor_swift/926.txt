 and i go back to december all the time 
 
 i know i 
 would this ever good 
 tell me 
 youâ€™ll never leave me 
 and there he goes, so perfectly, 
 the kind of flawless i wish you would 
 i wish you were with their applause 
 he's got a one-hand feel 
 on the steering wheel 
 the other on my heart 
 is it to the love they pushed aside 
 but people like me 
 i bet these memories 
 follow you around 
 you showed me what living is crying and i still wanna kiss without mistletoe? 
 what would happen if god never let it snow? 
 what would happen if god never let it snow? 
 what would happen if christmas carols told a lie? 
 tell me what would you find 
 
 this love is glowing in the dark 
 talking 'bout your daddy's farm 
 we were gonna be forever 
 or it's gonna go down in flames 
 there was nothing left to say when it all came down 
 
 wish i never
