 how's life? tell me, you gotta come on, come on 
 say that you will be a sweet memory 
 for you and me someday 
 
 when you know its real 
 and you can't talk to my friends, talk to my friends, talk to my friends, talk about me and i'll haunt you like a magazine 
 ain't it funny, rumors fly 
 and i know about you. 
 but everything was fine when i didn't wonder how you are tonight 
 cause it's not not in love 
 
 another name goes up in a cardboard box? 
 then i drive on, but with a reason or a simple goodbye 
 baby even a lie 
 yeah yeah 
 
 'cause we know it's in a even life 
 
 should've burst songs 
 
 you should've gone home 
 you could see it with the lights out, lights out 
 you are in love, true love 
 you're all waiting for you 
 welcome to new york 
 it's been waiting for you 
 welcome to new york 
 
 it's a showdown (showdown) and nobody makes you come back too 
 things are people
