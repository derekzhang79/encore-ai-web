 she said she was gonna be a game 
 with only this time 
 in case you haven't heard, 
 i was just as cold inside 
 he smiled and i smiled, well 
 and brought me around 
 instead of clowning around 
 i can feel my heart beating and said oh my my my ready 
 i hope the footage from the roof 
 i sat down and cried 
 
 oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day 
 you're still an innocent. 
 
 time what mine gave it away 
 this year, to save me from the very start 
 the meaning of love so nobody breaks my heart 
 
 never let me drive 
 you're a redneck heartbreak 
 who's really bad at lying 
 so here the whole thing 
 
 rain came pouring down when i was drowning 
 that's when i could finally breathe 
 and by morning and never scared 
 in the best thing that’s ever been mine. 
 
 flash forward and we’re taking on the nights 
 when you come back down 
 they go to work
