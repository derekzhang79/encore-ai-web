 
 gonna climb the way you laugh, 
 the way you love with that we’ve been through. 
 but i don’t know why there was hold 
 
 but here i am an open book 
 turn the page it’s all the rage 
 get a look on the inside 
 oh what you get is what you wanted 
 not even that is enough 
 
 ooh, ooh, i can't go there anymore… 'cause it's so damn funny [cd version] 
 that i drive you crazy 
 [album version line:] that's fine i'll tell you that you’re lucky. 
 but you’re so confused, 
 'cause there you are the best thing that’s where it was a girl at home, 
 and everybody knows that, 
 uh, uh 
 don't look at you 
 i won't tell nobody take it 
 fell back... be here. 
 
 before you love me 
 so go and tell your friends that i'm obsessive and crazy 
 [album version line:] that's fine i'll tell you to your door, 
 but i was too young 
 to be messed with? 
 the street 
 and you're the only thing i know
