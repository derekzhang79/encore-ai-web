 knowing you only knew me 
 i'm not 
 i wanna know how it feels to be 
 over you for real 
 
 every little piece love, 
 and don't you see 
 sweet before 
 that i wanted 
 but it were in school. 
 there are people you showed me so tonight 
 oh. 
 
 and that's how it sounded like it changes things 
 changes people and it changes names and everything but me and britney 
 
 oh, oh 
 only sound, only sound that you hear is "no" 
 you go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to my friends, talk to my friends, talk to my friends, talk to my friends, talk to my friends, and tell me about you 
 when it comes to you. 
 
 [chorus:] 
 i'm not the kind of girl 
 who should be rudely barging in on a fast and free 
 oh, oh 
 never gotta be so?... 
 and all you're ever gone 
 i know places 
 and i tell them that in prep school to do? 
 i'm hopelessly devoted to you 
 hopelessly devoted
