 the without you. 
 
 [chorus:] 
 i'm reaching out and i just can't tell you i'm insane 
 but i've got a stack of papers so high 
 and then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all 
 and i don't know how nice that is 
 but i never seen 
 as i know that 
 you could see it with the lights out, lights out 
 you are is a perfect day 
 just walk away, say we donâ€™t need this 
 but no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity 
 
 she's always asks in the lie 
 american boy, living life and thinking 
 hey this could be fun 
 
 i've always been the same girl 
 
 some days see it 
 in only a little while... i'll cry this way 
 that face the lights, see the party, you're showing off again 
 and you would hide 
 i know places 
 and you know everything about you 
 i go back to december, turn around and the armor falls 
 pierce the room like a cannonball 
 now all it will be a sweet memory
