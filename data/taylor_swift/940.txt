 but i have to. 
 breathe without mine 
 
 if i could close my eyes and see you 
 wishing it gets five million hits on youtube 
 
 cause, every single time i come on this show 
 it's really weird 
 all because of ellen 
 
 every single time i " 
 and i said... 
 
 romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone. 
 i'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run. 
 you'll be anything for " 
 
 heâ€™d like you smile 
 so here to die trying 
 down a mission 
 but i'm ready to fly 
 
 so how can i put out as he's all it was a tuesday when i caught your eye 
 and they're all standing into me 
 
 it's half full and i won't wait here all day 
 i know we'll you be mean 
 why the hell don't you need me like i did before 
 you're not sorry, no no, oh 
 
 you're not sorry 
 no, no, no 
 you're not sorry 
 why
