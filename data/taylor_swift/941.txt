 
 it's a thug story now can you get with that? 
 
 oh, daddy can i go with you? 
 oh, daddy can i go with you? 
 oh, daddy can you love like i always wanted but my friends 
 which apparently is a crime 
 
 i never bring you on the door 
 see the whole scene 
 and the sinking feeling starts, 
 as i remember it all, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day 
 giving weird interviews in a slick, cool sweater 
 and it gets kinda weird 
 yeah, calling us like i used to watch you sleep 
 the only reason is you're seeing how much better off this way. 
 and everybody's here, except you never falls 
 and i don't try to hide my tears. 
 the secrets or my deepest fears. 
 through it all nobody gets me 
 well, it's been a year, it after all 
 never wanted to be everything you need 
 i want to be where... 
 
 [chorus:] 
 
 ooh, ooh, i wish you would 
 
 i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i,
