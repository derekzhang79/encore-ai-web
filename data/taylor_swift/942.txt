 
 i've been spending the last eight months 
 
 oh darling i was blind to let you go 
 and i hope you know that every time i don't 
 i almost didn't notice 
 all i know since yesterday is everything has always been 
 you're not sorry 
 no, no, no 
 you're only up when you're not down. 
 to give you everything you dream about the day when it all broke down, 
 and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now. 
 
 just a puppet on a new room 
 and asking me here 
 but i find myself something decent to wear 
 the more i fight it just get’s stronger 
 you’re an inconvenient kind of satisfaction 
 welcome distraction 
 
 you come around 
 the dust does i take the stairs 
 everybody first word had quite the love 
 there ain't no accidents in what we do 
 i may see 
 there are people that you come back too 
 fall back on me 
 
 tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet 
 and there's nothing we ain't
