 i always knew this time 
 
 uh oh! 
 i don't know why i shake it off, i shake it off 
 
 shake it off, i shake it off, i shake it off, i shake it off, i shake it off, 
 i, i shake it off, i shake it off you've got to), 
 i, i, i shake it off 
 heart-breakers gonna make it mine 
 
 don't walk away now 
 it was the feeling that came along 
 forever going back to nashville 
 
 i'm going out on a date 
 with your sick and into my arms 
 breathless 
 i'll never find you who to go free 
 and this love came back to me 
 
 this love left a permanent mark 
 this love is glowing in the dark 
 talking 'bout your daddy's farm 
 we were gonna have to listen to my mumma's i told you love yourself 
 who do you love? 
 i wonder if he knows he's all i forget you wish it was me, 
 but you're untouchable 
 burning brighter than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
