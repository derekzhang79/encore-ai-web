 but it seems like one of those nights, 
 we ditch the whole scene 
 and i wanted to know how it gets better than this 
 you're the only thing i know since yesterday we don't have to 
 think of the distance in the cruelest oh 
 just close your eyes 
 see how this i will wait forever and i try to you. 
 and i forget you as the lights go down 
 
 i make the moves up as i go 
 and lead me out when i let you in 
 
 i please know to be in love with someone else 
 please don't have somebody waiting on you 
 please don't leave tonight 
 oh iâ€™m the chance to dance along in the light of my head 
 hopelessly devoted to you 
 hopelessly devoted to you 
 hopelessly devoted to you 
 
 but love's got your demons, and, darling, it was good baby 
 we showed 'um all up 
 they say i need to see you 
 the way you move when you walk by 
 that only see you and where are you? 
 so you
