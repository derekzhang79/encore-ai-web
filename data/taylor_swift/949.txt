 if i never felt like i was leaving too soon 
 and i know it's right for you 
 and i waited so frustrated 
 who’s gonna hold you 
 take me home 
 i just realized i just want to jinx my luck 
 i’ve left it all behind me 
 and i’ve been hoping every day 
 that someday you will find me 
 
 so i cross my heart and hope you're well 
 well i'm doing alright 
 if i could be your angel 
 a thousand smiles 
 now i make it so 
 if i could be sweet 
 sorry, but i know i had the best day 
 when the flowers we drive and drive 
 until we've found a killed 
 the time is ticking, 
 people ask me how i've been 
 but when you know you're 'bout one your paper 
 light of curious minds? 
 
 oh 
 
 oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
 
 and i don’t know 
 where i lost control 
 and couldn’t take it any longer 
 must ever come in a
