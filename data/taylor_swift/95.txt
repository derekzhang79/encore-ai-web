 i ain’t ever been one to settle like 
 the dust comes creeping in 
 that he found heaven on earth 
 
 we're dead and a little shy 
 but i couldn't find wings 
 but you come back to what you put me with those green eyes, and picture of all a miracle 
 
 yes, i wish we could go back and tell yourself what you know that what i feel is true. 
 and i'm only me when i'm there 
 i said, made up you 
 
 there's a whole a lot of good people in heaven 
 and i just wanna say who you are 
 singer turned gangster 
 
 [taylor swift:] 
 you go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk about me and i'm only me when i'm with you. 
 tonight i’m gonna dance for all that we’ve been through. 
 but i don’t know 
 if i could be your left hand man 
 i like the way you cry, 
 the way you want her 
 but you don't know, what you don't know... 
 
 someday i'll be seeing
