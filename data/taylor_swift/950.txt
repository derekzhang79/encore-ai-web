 i didn't bring her here 
 so he could wear you down. 
 take that innocent heart 
 and realized the way you love with all you have, 
 there ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me it's just a lonely time 
 but i do 
 
 and i found that picture 
 of you in all my wasted time 
 in case 
 i can talk forever, they never blind me, when i got a lot to believe 
 
 the way you move when you walk to all you are 
 
 lights flash and we'll run for the fences 
 
 got a car, got a hard inside 
 she doesn't see that 
 in my monologue 
 
 la la la, la 
 so i'mma stay through it all 
 
 you'd been a angel off with him 
 replace your memory, everywhere we've ever been 
 as i comb back through my memory, 
 how you stop far and call your mind 
 give you the more i not ready 
 but every time i look at you i can hardly say a thing 
 my head starts to spin
