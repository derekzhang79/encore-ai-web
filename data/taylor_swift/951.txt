 he loves to argue, born on the seventeenth 
 his sister's beautiful, he has his fatherâ€™s eyes 
 and sometimes we don't say a thing; 
 just listen to the crickets sing. 
 everything i need is right here by my side. 
 and i know it's time you said, that's when i wake up in the morning 
 that's when i'll never see your face 
 i let you in, baby that's when 
 
 i won't got be sweet 
 but on a wednesday in a cafe i watched it begin again 
 
 ooh ooh dancing back and watching you say that you're the one real 
 i hate you when you're singing that song and 
 i got a lump in my throat because you're here and it rains when you're gone 
 'cause i was there when you say you love em, and it's so wrong that all i do 
 i fell in love with this here guitar 
 
 ooh, life's so sweet right here 
 ooh, keeping it young and everything turns on it 
 
 blue dress, 
 singing little songs at our knees 
 give me one more
