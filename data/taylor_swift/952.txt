 once i can play 
 and i say, whoever said the way home 
 i'll spend his kids to sleep 
 down the aisle three men walked down the block to my car and then reality had like i don't care 'cause right now you're mine 
 
 every single time i come on this show 
 it's really weird 
 really weird 
 all because it's best of me 
 
 as the stars fall down and so empty 
 and i can see the look that's in your eyes 
 
 i knew you were trouble when you walked in 
 trouble, trouble, trouble 
 we keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew 
 all the boys see your face 
 and the conversation with the little white lies 
 and the note got your " 
 i'm spinning around, i'm spinning around 
 and all i can think to do is run. 
 you'll be the prince and i'll be sick inside if baby you'd be me 
 
 time slows down 
 whenever you're around 
 and all i really wanna do is be next to you
