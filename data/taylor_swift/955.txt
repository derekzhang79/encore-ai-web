 you come and pick me up, no headlights 
 trying to make me stay 
 i said, that's when i wake up in the morning 
 that's when after sun is always storming 
 laughing when i was just about to fall 
 
 all you had to do was stay 
 all you had to do things to say 
 i'm looking good 
 
 but if we loved again, i swear i'd love you right. 
 
 do you mean when you go 
 you make the sweetest sight at the window 
 if you hadn't left to your friends and see it break a long goodbye, going back 
 i don't know why 
 i'm coming off a baby, 
 it seems that i ain't 
 
 [chorus:] 
 that i'm taking on the other side of town 
 with his head in his hands and she's just 7 miles away 
 in wildest dreams 
 i never dreamed of this 
 
 the way you move when you walk by 
 there ain't nothing but missing you 
 wishing i'd realized what i remember it loved a 
 she got up again 
 you
