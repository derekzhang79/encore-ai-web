 after all those wishes on planes 
 we thought were stars 
 memories all you ever wanted was right there 
 a thousand smiles 
 now i think i am finally clean 
 think i'm finally clean 
 said i think when it's all over, 
 it just all comes out

 cause i remember it all, all, all... too well. 
 
 pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks to red up like coming undone 
 it's a love we run 
 
 baby, i know places we stood again, 
 i said, oh 
 uh, oh, oh 
 
 and that's the way i loved you 
 breaking down and coming undone 
 it's a roller coaster love be a sweet memory 
 for the fun i've missed 
 think of all the fun i've missed 
 think i'm finally clean 
 can't take what's ours 
 
 but like a light on me and plain ol' jane 
 told a head in his mind 
 when he plays a song and you don't leave go like a green and you and i thought
