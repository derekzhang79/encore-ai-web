 
 ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
 la, la la, la 
 la la, la 
 so when i first my song in the mirror saw her cry 
 she got a stack of papers so high 
 and it's all about you baby 
 keep thinking your future was me. 
 
 last christmas i gave you my heart 
 but the very next day, you gave it away 
 this year, to save you 
 all the better just to please things but i just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now 
 i was right there beside him all summer long of the floor 
 its your fault i could be sweet 
 sorry, but i know i've been a lot of lonely places 
 i've never been wanted around 
 
 [chorus:] 
 i can't wait for the day i stop pretending 
 that i'm not a little girl anymore 
 cause i'm a fast train 
 blowing through a mountain 
 watching all my life 
 got his problems, bills to pay 
 show me from the very start 
 the meaning of love so nobody breaks my perfect fantasy
