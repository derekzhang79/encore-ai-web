 oh, oh.. 
 
 ooh, ooh, come a little closer 
 oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, 
 oh, oh, 
 oh, i remember you driving to another that covered my eyes and trying to look busy, 
 and that was a small town 
 and i didn't get this song that day 
 in the palm from your cheeks were turning red. 
 you used to be a sweet memory 
 for a things that's the way you lost me 
 i'm sick and tired of your head back laughing like a hero 
 on a path across the blue sky 
 i put myself a big ol serving to pay back 
 i had you figured out 
 can't breathe whenever you're gone 
 can't turn back now, it's all good. 
 i wish you would 
 
 all the roses 
 and the note that said,.. 
 
 [chorus:] 
 i hope you think of me 
 and everything will no you and i, 
 and a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life 
 we're all here, the lights and noise are blinding 
 we hang back, it's all in the
