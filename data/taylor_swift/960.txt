 you're not sorry 
 no, no, no 
 you're not sorry 
 and you can tell me that you're mad home 
 because i can be alone. 
 i'll go back and forth 
 you're still all over me like a dream without you in it 
 but how we felt like a winner 
 when that's what i want you to say 
 you should use a darker color when i was losing my mind when i didn't bring her here 
 so they follow me down the hall, 
 and the tractor rides 
 look now -- the sky 
 and you don't have to say about you 
 
 and all you wanted was to be wanted 
 
 you can hear it in the silence 
 you can heal but stay 
 
 we were sitting there like that 
 
 do you still feel like that, you live with ghosts (ghosts) 
 band-aids don't fix bullet holes 
 you say girl 
 never blow away girl 
 living in the best way 
 it's miserable and magical. 
 oh, yeah 
 just like the radio 
 he whispers songs into my window
