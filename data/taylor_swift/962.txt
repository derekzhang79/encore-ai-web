 yeah, yeah, red 
 we're burning red 
 hey yeah whatâ€™s the word on you 
 lay me in the lie 
 american boy, living life as it goes 
 you two are dancing in a simple way, 
 4 am, the second day, 
 how strange that i don't know how it gets better than this 
 you take my hand and drag me head first 
 and i can teach you 
 all i know is i was enchanted to meet you 
 
 waiting for the words 
 
 and that small town daydream 
 lasted all night 
 cussing out all those bright city lights 
 just look at you as you find a day new 
 don't fade away 
 never fade 
 
 christ the savior is born 
 christ our savior is born 
 christ our savior is born 
 
 silent night, holy night 
 son of god 
 love's pure light 
 radiant beams from thy holy face 
 when i said, i'll never let you know 
 all the sleepless nights or the endless fights 
 i used to roll the dice 
 feel the fear in
