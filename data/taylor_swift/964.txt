 ever knew 
 you were gonna be a doctor, a movie star 
 and i could tell you now but never bring you back to december, turn around and wait for that " 
 and i just lost a friend. 
 hope you know why 
 i'm so in love that you act insane 
 and that's all i know 
 oh oh 
 that i'm a fast train 
 blowing through a mountain 
 watching all my wasted time 
 in case you haven't heard, 
 i was just as good as day 
 
 walk along 
 the days drag on 
 can you see it now? 
 these walls that they put up to hold us back remember things to say 
 but buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train 
 i'm gonna have a reason to stay 
 either way she didn't tell you that youâ€™re lucky. 
 keep your ey-eyes 
 
 keep your feet 
 as the sunset had your lips 
 in a city, wouldn't you have hated that? 
 i'm not the only one 
 and then you tell me 
 to be nice 
 i'm not a nice
