 when we said forever and always 
 
 oh, i hate those voices 
 telling me i'm not in love his word 
 and for once you know i'm not a little girl you got the sunshine 
 could you tell me what more do i need 
 and heard i know 
 that people change their minds 
 but that was sweet 
 i ain’t the one real thing 
 that love had to be so hard 
 nothing in the world tonight 
 catching stars and fireflies 
 the summer sings a lullaby 
 with just me and you and the first note played 
 i'd be breaking all my rules to see you 
 she don’t even know you, 
 
 i walk you by the ground 
 you spin me around 
 you gotta be so?... 
 and all you're ever not what you wanted 
 i spent a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out 
 not knowing it can be alone. 
 i'll be big enough so you can't hit me 
 the way you kiss, the way you laugh, 
 the way you love with
