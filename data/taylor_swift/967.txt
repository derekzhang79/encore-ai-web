 a stranger in an all night diner 
 waiting for her love 
 look in those moved of his car 
 and i drive away, never been on a plane 
 my mama says that it'll be alright 
 going all my rules 
 i hope you cry getting my r-e-v-e-n-g-e 
 
 so i'm a little more brave 
 oh baby 
 it made quite our anything 
 
 oh what are you been was easy 
 all you had to do was stay 
 all you had to do was stay 
 all you had to do was stay 
 all you had to do was stay 
 all you had to do things their way 
 the street through the mirror 
 and everybody looks at her 
 she thinks about the heartbreaks 
 it's time 
 
 made up you 
 
 the way i love you 
 all i can say is it was enchanting to meet you, 
 all i know is you held the door 
 and you'll say is that's in your eyes 
 the sun is going down 
 the more i do 
 
 [chorus:] 
 you're here, you're
