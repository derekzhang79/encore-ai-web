 
 diving off into the deep part of 
 the night you danced like you made me run and one without you? 
 
 i might tell you i'm insane 
 but i've with me. 
 
 hope you think you are? 
 to sit outside my window throwing pebbles 
 screaming, i'm in love with " 
 
 and that's how it gets better than this 
 you take my hand and drag me head first 
 in my makeup again 
 he says he's so in love that you act insane 
 and that's the way i loved you 
 
 so don't let go 
 we are alone 
 going through the photographs, staring at night to call your name. 
 and we were happy 
 oh-oh, oh-oh-oh 
 we both wake in lonely beds in different cities 
 and the sinking feeling starts, 
 as i say hopelessly, 
 he said he'd be " 
 
 'cause i loved you around 
 
 the way you love with all you have, 
 i’ll meet you, when i said, speak " 
 and me and hope i’m right
