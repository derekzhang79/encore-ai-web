 there's a whole a lot of good people in heaven 
 and i don't wanna come down 
 so i can make a good time 
 cleaning up that mess 
 
 we had a beautiful magic love there 
 what are you gonna do 
 and i know it's no and it rains when you're gone 
 i was a dreamer before you went and let me know it's not easy, easy for me. 
 
 he’d never tell you but he can fly 
 why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart? 
 
 maybe i should've seen the signs, should've read the writing on the dash 
 since the feeling ain’t strong 
 she had to know the passwords to your emails, everything you do 
 i ain't jealous of you 
 just thought you should know 
 when we said forever and always 
 
 was i out of line? 
 did i say something way too honest? 
 made you made a deep brown eyes has thought he just might find 
 who were you and where are you? 
 and you come away with a great little story 
 of
