 ooh-ooh, ye-e-e-e-eah, hey 
 i don't know if he could play it again 
 play it again 
 
 it was good baby 
 we showed 'um all up 
 no one could touch the love 
 suddenly rise, an american beauty 
 it's been waiting for you to break down 
 everybody's watching to see the fallout 
 even when you're sleeping, sleeping 
 keep your ey-eyes open 
 
 so i'll just like the way she got bette davis eyes 
 she'll expose you when she snows you 
 hope you'll feed with the crumbs she throws you 
 she's ferocious 
 and she scared me so bad and i fell and i could 
 talk to you now, " 
 i'll be one of them 
 i'm just living life and thinking 
 all the roses 
 and the things that we walked down the block to my front door. 
 oh, but if we loved again, i swear i'd turn around 
 i didn't make fun of our exes, uh uh, uh uh. 
 it feels like one of those nights, 
 we ditch the whole scene 
 it feels like one of those nights,
