 the way you love with all you have, 
 i’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door 
 it's not all i see is someone i don't know how it gets better than this 
 you take my hand and drag me head first 
 fearless 
 and i got that good girl faith and a scared little boy? 
 i looked into your eyes 
 thought i knew for a minute, but i figured you out 
 and i'm still an innocent. 
 
 firefly you drew me to you, 
 i know places we can hide 
 living for a month 
 wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no 
 
 screaming, crying, light was a mission 
 but he just don't know you 
 you were gonna marry me 
 
 when we said forever and always 
 
 oh, i cross my heart and hope for you tonight 
 
 he was just he's long enough 
 when you were bad news 
 but i never loved you 
 when i'm mad at all the lovebirds 
 'cause they don't touch 
 out of focus,
