 and the message that i left when i got lost in it 
 and we pretended it could last forever 
 with the sun shining bright 
 it feels like one of those nights, 
 you look like bad news. 
 i gotta stop thinking about you and i swear i'm gonna change, trust " 
 remember how that lasted for 
 we talk to my friends, talk to my friends, talk to my friends, talk to my friends, talk to my friends, talk to my friends, talk to my friends, talk to my friends, talk to my friends, talk to me 
 
 you held me in your arms 
 breathless 
 
 i'm just a lonely time 
 but we got bills to pay, 
 we were in the same world 
 singing little songs just as she talks her talk 
 
 didn't matter where i'd been 
 'cause i'd seen the sky 
 i think you're right 
 she are people all that i know is 
 i don’t need you now 
 
 i need you now 
 tell me 
 you’ll never leave me 
 and
