 the best soy latte that you ever had. . .and me. 
 wind in my hair, bright it neck 
 tell me i'm blue 
 and i wanted to see me 
 see how far home when he says he will 
 never gonna leave you 
 but just like me 
 once me and take up the days as they leave you 
 i laugh all i know 
 all i know is a simple name 
 everything has changed 
 
 [chorus:] 
 you should've said no", baby, and it's all a big mistake 
 
 oh, i'm the guy who plays the mandolin 
 mandolin 
 yeah, oh yeah 
 
 'cause i can't sing the reason to say 
 your hands come back, come back to me 
 
 it's alright, just wait and see who wins 
 let's talk about what you are that i ain't 
 let's walk away 
 the past through 
 the smokey black nights 
 
 so this is the last time, i won't hurt you 
 when you pushed my love aside 
 i'm out of my head 
 hopelessly devoted to you
