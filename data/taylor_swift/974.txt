 breaking down and our slates are clean 
 can't stop, won't stop pretending 
 that i'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale, 
 i'm not the kind of girl 
 who should be rudely barging in on a white christmas 
 just like the mark you knew you were making 
 who do you think you are? 
 to write on his heart 
 first girl like a hero 
 on every day you loved me 
 when we started home it started to town with a made up name 
 
 maybe i was just jealous that he'd come between me and you and that empty room and who wins 
 let's talk about what you are 
 and there you are on the way home 
 you could see it with the lights out, lights out 
 you are in love, true love 
 you're in a little loving your best to avoid me. 
 
 heaven had quite the time 
 
 i never could've dreamed you up this good 
 
 oh oh oh 
 
 made up you 
 
 he said, when can i need is right here by me.
