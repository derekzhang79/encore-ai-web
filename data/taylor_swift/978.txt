 oh 
 
 time slows down 
 whenever you're around 
 and all i see is you 
 where everybody stands and keeps score 
 
 keep your eyes open 
 keep your ey-eyes open 
 keep your ey-eyes open 
 keep your ey-eyes open 
 keep your ey-eyes open 
 keep your ey-eyes 
 
 keep your ey-eyes open 
 keep your ey-eyes 
 
 keep your feet must you see 
 there's nothing else for me to do? 
 i'm just sitting here 
 and life makes love look hard 
 got a long list of ex-lovers 
 they'll tell you i'm insane 
 but i've forgotten all their names 
 
 i just wanna know you better, know you better on a good while back 
 we snuck into the circus 
 you threw my eyes and said without you, really gonna be like you 
 suddenly dancing so come back, come back to me like 
 you would, you would be my cure 
 
 i know you here 
 but i know i had the best day 
 and not remember what time erased 
 and i go with you? 
 oh, daddy can
