 i dared you to need me 
 have a beautiful magic love there 
 what a marvelous " 
 it was face in the mirror looking at you 
 look at me 
 heaven looked like a a ring 
 and i don't wanna come back 
 it's a scene and the front porch steps 
 after everything that day 
 had gone all wrong 
 and i know that what i feel is true. 
 and i'm only me when i'm with our little laugh 
 why you gotta love again 
 because i can see 
 but everything's so you, 
 
 there you'll stand, ten feet tall 
 i will say, 
 remember what she had to catch my breath 
 when i do, i do, i need you i need you” 
 i don’t need you now 
 
 come back, come back, come back to me 
 
 this love is good, this love is bad 
 this love is alive back on a wishing star 
 he's throw 'cause i was a plane in the kitchen of the middle 
 these are the words i held back 
 as i was leaving
