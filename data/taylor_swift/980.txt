 i could tell you incredible 
 and my heart's not breaking 
 cause i'm not trying to show maturity 
 
 "x" is the shape i drew through your face 
 in front of everyone you know? 
 'cause what do you see, when you look in his eyes 
 he’ll never fall in love with this here guitar 
 just let it flow 
 let it take me where it wants to go 
 'til you have to hit me, we're not around 
 i need you tonight 
 
 dreaming dreams with happy endings 
 in backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords 
 but now we've got bad blood, hey! 
 
 [verse 2 you've got bette davis eyes 
 she'll turn the music on you, you loved me 
 when we started home it started to rain 
 you put your eyes on me 
 standing in a nice dress, 
 staring at the sunset, babe 
 red lips and rosy cheeks 
 say you'll see me again 
 
 i’ll catch me now 
 
 i just wanna show you 
 she don’t even know if it's ever left you in
