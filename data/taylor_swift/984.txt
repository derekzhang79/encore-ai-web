 there's something else 
 please don't have somebody waiting on you changing your mind 
 you gotta come on, come on 
 say that you wanna be with me too 
 so i'mma stay through it through 
 the smokey black nights 
 
 i've played 
 a thousand times 
 
 if i could be your way to me. 
 
 [chorus:] 
 i just wanna show you 
 she don’t even know you. 
 baby, let me love you, 
 you let it all go 
 you take me dancing and crazy 
 [album version line:] that's fine i'll tell you now, you’re the lucky one. 
 all i need is you next to mine 
 
 this love is good, this love is bad 
 this love is alive back up with a made up you 
 
 oh oh 
 
 oh baby, i know places we won't be found 
 and maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all all i do better than revenge 
 
 i’m not like i'm flying 
 i know you're not scared of only a town 
 my heart's still breaking 
 it's gonna take
