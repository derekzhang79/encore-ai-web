 when it doesn't 
 
 [repeat chorus] 
 
 should have all worked out 
 but he's wrong and you should use a darker color when i got my heart broken 
 close enough to hope you couldn't see 
 the more i did it on 
 
 going back to naaaaahh.... 
 
 going back to naaaaahh.... 
 
 going back to naaaaahh.... 
 
 going back to again 
 
 it feels like one of those nights, 
 you look like an angel, 
 can't help it if i wanna try again with you. 
 and i could tell you now but never you 
 i want you please let me, 
 back in your heart 
 
 oh, and they come unstuck 
 
 lady, running down to the riptide 
 taken away to the dark side 
 i keep all i need you 
 
 when all 
 and this love came back to me 
 
 this love you to only love you 
 when i get a little crazy 
 well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me 
 merry christmas, i wrapped it up and sent it 
 with a note
