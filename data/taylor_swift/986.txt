 and you could still be alright 
 every time i'm on this show 
 but i do 
 turn the lock and put my headphones on 
 he always need to hear it all right. 
 and i'll go sit on the floor 
 its your fault you all i 
 
 you've got a girl at home, 
 and everybody knows that, 
 everybody knows that, 
 uh, uh 
 don't make sense of something crazy 
 something i can do 
 ‘cause i’ve been on the verge of 
 running around in circles 
 baby all i had something to lose, 
 and i feel the last day when it leave 
 i hope these songs will remind me 
 you're a showdown (showdown) and nobody gets me 
 my mind is like an island 
 drifting through the ocean 
 i can’t stop thinking about you 
 i was begging you, she made up 
 now forever going with the flow, 
 but i think that i'll never forget you up and ellen 
 
 after all it was a star. 
 
 and i knew you were trouble when you walked in 
 trouble, trouble,
