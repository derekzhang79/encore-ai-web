 
 we loved again, i swear i'd love you right. 
 
 could you tell me what you do 
 i just want but just what it just like a perfect day 
 just you wanna open the world 
 
 long live the walls we crashed through 
 give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar 
 sweet, sweet superstar, superstar 
 
 we need the fire 
 if you only knew me 
 i'm just living life and thinking 
 hey this could be fun 
 
 when they said, speak " 
 and i'm not a saint 
 and iâ€™ve been holding on 
 way too long 
 but not another minute 
 i got lost in it 
 and as we walked 
 we were sitting at our favorite spot in town 
 and you can hear it in the silence 
 you can see that i've been crying 
 you're not sorry no no oh 
 
 all that's if i was there, i call self control 
 'cause i never hung up the phone and she whispers back, 
 
 missing you like this is such sweet sorrow 
 won't you
