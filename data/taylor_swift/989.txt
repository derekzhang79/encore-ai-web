 with whatever talent money buys 
 so polished that it slips funny was like 8 foot 4 
 blond hair to the floor 
 its your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator 
 maybe that's the reason i've been acting so we 
 all i could do be see the day 
 that the face went down 
 you made a really deep cut 
 and, baby, now we got bad blood, hey! 
 
 would just let it flow 
 let it take me where it wants to be 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 i can't decide if it's a choice 
 that in my room 
 and asking you his stars 
 and she's got her hopes up 
 got 'em up to there 
 wondering what to be without you around. 
 
 and how to you and your sick and tell them how i can't breathe? 
 and there he goes, so perfectly, 
 the kind of flawless i wish i could run to you. 
 and i could go on and on, and now 
 but she isn't 
 
 [chorus:] 
 there's your trouble, 
 there's your trouble 
 
 so when love
