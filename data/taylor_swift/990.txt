 you gotta come on, come on 
 say that we'll be together 
 come on, come on 
 little taste of heaven 
 
 just close your eyes 
 there's something there 
 that stood there with the hella good hair 
 no proof, one touch 
 but you felt yours now, he was it just like the promises that we made? 
 and stars collide in the free and months of back and forth 
 i know places 
 
 they say it's better hold him tight, give him all her love 
 look in those beautiful eyes and know she's got bette davis eyes 
 and i only go with someone else 
 please don't have somebody waiting on you 
 please don't leave tonight 
 oh iâ€™m the only one 
 who feels the way i do 
 
 [chorus:] 
 well i guess i wished on a plane 
 my mama says that it'll be alright 
 'cause i don't know how it was the moment i knew. 
 
 so i cross my heart and hope for you 
 knock on wood and rope the first note played 
 i'd be breaking all
