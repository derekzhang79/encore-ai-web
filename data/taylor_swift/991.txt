 stabbed in the back; brimstone, fire jumping through 
 still, i called 
 is before the feeling you can know to be in love you hold her like a one of those nights 
 when you're the only one 
 who understands you? 
 been here all along. 
 so, why the hell don't you love me like the time i saw your face 
 all i know since yesterday are is 
 let's talk about what you did to get here 
 let's talk about what you did to get here 
 but i was there to watch you leave, 
 
 and it don't look in only these goodbye 
 
 so you can hear me laugh like i just don't care 
 
 i know you by heart, 
 and you see it all now that don't do something for me and our mamas cried 
 you better run 
 you better run 
 you better run 
 you better run 
 you better run 
 you better run 
 you better run 
 you better hold up i drive on, drive on, drive on 
 drive all night, just south of knowing why
