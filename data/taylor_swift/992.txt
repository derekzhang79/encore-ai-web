 
 just grab my hand and don't ever leave me 
 
 bye, bye, to everything i thought was on my side 
 bye, bye, baby 
 now we've go crashing down, we come back every time 
 'cause one second it was perfect 
 he's not all bad 
 can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken 
 the best people in life are free 
 
 you might as well forget my name 
 we are alone, just like the two kids making up for lost love 
 
 christmas lights glisten, 
 i've got security lining this stage 
 this is my musical monologue 
 
 you might come down 
 this revolution, throw your hands up 
 'cause you don't think me don't you ever grow up 
 don't you ever grow up, just stay this little 
 
 i didn't bring you up 
 when i could only find the strength to leave 
 you'd be with me, so every time you lost me 
 make you feel so hard 
 it all disappeared lying on the road to go 
 we both stay, stay, stay. 
 
 stay, stay, stay.
