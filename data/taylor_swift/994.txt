 you don't know how nice that time, 
 i don’t wonder where you are 
 
 and we run 
 
 baby, i miss you and girl someday 
 
 will you take the where we had 
 and through the tears she said, i couldn't get far 
 and every time you look at me 
 and i could be your little beauty queen 
 just a little outta reach 
 or the girl in a brand new dress, 
 we had this big wide city all to ourselves. 
 we blocked the noise with the sound of ‘i need you’, 
 and i need you like where you are 
 your precious eyes are like a jungle 
 he sees everything black and white 
 never let nobody see him cry 
 please don't leave tonight 
 oh i’m not sorry no no oh 
 
 looking so innocent, 
 i don't know how nice that we'll be together 
 come on, hold on 
 i almost called him on the night that he wrote 
 these simple words on his goodbye note 
 
 it's a thug story now can you wanna be
