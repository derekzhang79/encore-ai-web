 you hand me a rose and a car up the stairs 
 and he caught a sound of my face 
 but you run away 
 
 because i'll be big enough so you tell me for a second you would call 
 and now you're not sorry 
 no, no, no 
 you're not sorry 
 and tell me 
 and i wish that all your roads would lead you right to me 
 
 when you come back, 
 everything will be alright 
 no you wrong 
 and i can picture it all the lovebirds 
 'cause they don't know how he was back then 
 locked up in your arms of my hair undone 
 in the front seat of his car 
 when he plays a song it brings along 
 everybody saying 
 who's that guy who plays the mandolin... mandolin 
 oh iâ€™m sorry for that " 
 so i question everything you do do do 
 watching what you say 
 we'll rock our babies on that very first day 
 think i'm finally clean 
 keep a proved really somethin' this life like a record changer 
 the rumors are
