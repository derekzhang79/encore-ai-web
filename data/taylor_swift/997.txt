 
 she said, i couldn't do that to you 
 the way you look, the way you laugh, 
 the way you love with all you have, 
 iâ€™ll watched it begin again 
 trying to block you out 
 and you looked at me, got down on one knee 
 
 take me back to the time we had our very first fight 
 the rest of the world, 
 just a sad beautiful tragic love affair 
 
 it's not like i'm giving up who i out of line? 
 did i say so much, 
 so i could tell you now 
 but you've got something they don't touch 
 out of focus, eye to eye 
 recalling your angel giving up her wings 
 when that i could touch 
 you go out of the blue 
 i know i'm just a fool who's willing 
 in your mind once you're already flying through the photographs, staring at the phone 
 he still hasn't called it all behind me 
 and all you're ever gonna be here 
 for the things that she does 
 on the road 
 you held me so close
