 
 long live it, could you just be simple 
 
 'cause i'm not trying to show maturity 
 
 cause i guess i never been on a plane 
 my mama says that it'll be alright 
 but i don’t wanna dance if i’m not dancing with you. 
 tonight i’m gonna dance like you were in this room. 
 but i don’t wanna dance if i’m not dancing with you, 
 
 i have no one else of who can take the keys 
 next the doors were closed at me, 
 but there was one thing missing, 
 and that was the first day. 
 
 and they take the time to memorize me: 
 my fears, the hidden beauty 
 but i can't help but feel when i called 
 
 she's not a saint 
 and an open book 
 to hear sleigh bells in the snow 
 
 i'm dreaming of a white christmas 
 just like the ones i used to know 
 so may your days be merry and bright 
 and may all your christmases be white 
 
 may your days be merry and bright
