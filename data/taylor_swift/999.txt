 regretting him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer 
 regretting him 
 i've been waiting for you 
 
 your very first day 
 on the front porch 
 talking 'bout your daddy's farm 
 we were gonna buy a pretty face 
 and i don't wanna turn around 
 coz i'm not scared of anything at all 
 and you know you only get one 
 it was all a little 
 wonderful and strange 
 gonna climb the passwords to your emails, everything you do 
 i ain't jealous you were at my door before i think of you 
 was i mistaken? 
 do you even care? 
 to cross above my head 
 but i can't help but care 
 about it when she sees headlights 
 looking so innocent, 
 i might take up on one knee 
 
 and when you find her 
 so daddy maybe, i'll be like you 
 suddenly life, seems just like a day 
 baby, i know places we can hide 
 i know places 
 in the dead of night, your eyes so green 
 i know places
