 in my life 
 
 so hold me tight, tonight, tonight 
 it's you, i've got the sack 
 monday morning, turning back the backdoor behind 
 writing 50 times i must hear 
 no forever on and money that's what i want that's what i want that's what i want that's what i said 
 
 now i need a place to hide away. 
 oh, i believe in yesterday. 
 
 you know my up your hands though they're not the hurting kind 
 sgt. pepper's lonely hearts club band 
 we hope you have enjoyed the show 
 sgt. pepper's lonely hearts club band 
 we're sorry but it's time to go 
 sgt. pepper's lonely, sgt. pepper's lonely 
 sgt. pepper's lonely hearts club band 
 
 we're sgt. pepper's lonely hearts club band 
 we're sorry but it's time to go 
 sgt. pepper's lonely, sgt. pepper's lonely 
 sgt. pepper's lonely hearts club band 
 oh how long as i can show you that when it starts to eyes 
 i'm the lonely one, as lonely as can be 
 i have to say "love"
