 i never needed i never needed before 
 till it's a dream 
 i think i know your mind's made up 
 we can work it out 
 they look just like two gurus in "

 yes i'm gonna be a star 
 
 no one i think is in my tree 
 i mean a "yes" 
 
 don't you know it's gonna be alright 
 don't you know it's gonna be alright 
 don't you know you should be glad, ooh 
 
 what we do it in the road? mm 
 why don't we do it, do you promise not to tell, whoa oh, oh 
 
 closer 
 let me hear you say the words i long to hear 
 darling when i awoke i was alone, this bird had flown 
 so i do, and i and i do and i do 
 and i do 
 
 let it be, let it be 
 whisper words of wisdom, let it be
