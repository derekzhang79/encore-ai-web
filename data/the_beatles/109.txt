 
 i don't know why you 
 should want you too 
 and if you ever even try 
 i'm sure to fall in love with you 
 and i'm gone 
 just look into my eyes 
 smiles awake you when you rise 
 sleep, pretty darling, do not cry 
 and i will sing a lullaby 
 
 golden slumbers fill your eyes 
 and i'll close mine 
 good night, sleep tight 
 now the moon begins to shine 
 good night, sleep tight 
 now the moon begins to shine 
 good night, sleep tight 
 now the sun turns out his light 
 good night, sleep tight 
 dream sweet dreams for you 
 
 close your eyes 
 that's the number for a new
