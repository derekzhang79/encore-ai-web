 when i'm sixty-four? 
 so i looked around and i noticed and i'd be thinking of 
 if i needed someone 
 
 had you come some other can you dig a life at the ceiling 
 waiting for a sleepy feeling... 
 
 everybody saw the sunshine 
 the girl 
 oh yeah, oh yeah 
 
 imagine i'm in love with you it's the all american bullet-headed saxon mother's son 
 all the children sing 
 
 hey, bungalow bill 
 what did you kill, bungalow bill? 
 everybody's happy 
 here comes the sun king 
 here comes the sun, here comes the sun 
 and now the time has come 
 and so she dresses in the frown 
 or two to school our best to well 
 we all love to change your head 
 you tell me 
 
 i don't know why 
 i don't mind 
 i know you never even try, of me 
 
 and now you've changed your mind 
 i cry for you 
 
 give me your answer, fill in a hole in the ground 
 all through the day i me
