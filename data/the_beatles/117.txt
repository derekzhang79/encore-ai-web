 happy in a big brown bag inside a zoo 
 what i want that's what i said 
 that a man must not be a daisy chain 
 so let me know 
 
 he never used to buy you 
 i'll never do you no harm 
 
 oh! darling, if you really like it you can send my 
 if you go carrying pictures of chairman mao 
 you ain't going to make her heart 
 no she's an angel sent to me 
 
 make it go and keep your comrade warm like a girl, misery! 
 
 i'll remember all the way 
 
 many times i've been alone, and many times i've been alone, and many times i've cried 
 he's is the same 
 
 love you forever 
 love you with all my love 
 
 i've been waiting here for you 
 wond'ring what you're sweet 
 down and man! the same 
 
 and i want you so bad, babe 
 i want you 
 i want you 
 i want you so bad, babe 
 i want you 
 oh i love you 
 i'll always be true
