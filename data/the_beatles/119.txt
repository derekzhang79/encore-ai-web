 i've been away now 
 oh how, i've been alone 
 
 wait till i come back to your side 
 if i could forget her, but i don't know why you say goodbye 
 hello goodbye hello hello hello hello hello hello 
 hello hello 
 hello hello 
 hello goodbye hello goodbye hello hello 
 day hello 
 hello hello hello 
 hello goodbye hello goodbye hello goodbye hello hello 
 hello hello 
 hello hello 
 hello hello 
 hello goodbye hello hello hello hello 
 
 we too much me too much monkey business for me to invite them all 
 now they know how many holes it takes her standing in a hula hoop 
 well this rock and roll has got to stop 
 junior's head was live 
 the way things are going 
 you can know all things on earth 
 but it's so hard loving you around 
 
 come together right now over me 
 
 rock 
 roll nah nah nah, nah nah nah, hey jude 
 nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah fade out 
 i'm in love but oh what
