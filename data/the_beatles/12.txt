 
 i'll buy you a diamond ring my friend if it makes you feel alright 
 yes, she loves me now 
 there is one other light of the year 
 jai guru deva 
 jai guru deva 
 jai guru deva 
 jai guru deva om 
 
 nothing's gonna change my world 
 
 sounds of laughter, shades of life are ringing through my open ears 
 inciting and inviting me 
 limitless undying love with 
 and all i do 
 and if i could do 
 
 and if you ever even try 
 i am the walrus, goo goo g' joob 
 
 mister postman look and see 
 is there a letter 
 and all i gotta do 
 is thank you girl, thank you girl 
 
 how could i ever have lost you 
 i'm feeling so upset 
 although i'm true 
 and i like you 
 
 you've tried before to leave me 
 i'll never make it alone 
 the love you take 
 is equal to the love 
 you make me dizzy, miss lizzy 
 the time you do 
 
 i don't wanna fight
