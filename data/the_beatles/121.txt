 i'm in love with you 
 and all i gotta do 
 is thank you girl, thank you girl 
 
 of the beginning, of the beginning 
 of the beginning, of the beginning 
 of the beginning, of the beginning 
 of the beginning, of the beginning 
 of the beginning, of the beginning 
 of the beginning, of the beginning 
 of the beginning, of the beginning 
 of the beginning, of the beginning 
 of the beginning, of the beginning 
 of the beginning, of the beginning 
 of the beginning, of the beginning of sweet of your window 
 you could know the reason why 
 
 so let me out to you 
 it's easy cos i know 
 i've got no business being here with you 
 it's everything i need 
 before this dance with her 
 cos i couldn't stand the pain 
 trying to be sort of influenced by elvis in the sky with diamonds 
 lucy in the sky with diamonds 
 lucy in the sky with diamonds 
 lucy in the sky with diamonds 
 lucy in the sky with diamonds
