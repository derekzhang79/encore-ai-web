 i'll pray and pray more each day 
 cos we love you, mr. moonlight 
 
 mr. moonlight, come again 
 maxwell stands alone 
 for so many years bye bye 
 
 friday day sunshine, good day sunshine, good little burning! 
 
 ... of the beginning, of the beginning 
 of the beginning, of the beginning 
 of the beginning, of the beginning 
 of the beginning, of the beginning 
 of the beginning, of the beginning 
 of the beginning, of the beginning 
 of the beginning, of the beginning 
 of the beginning, of the knee 
 and what are you on my old front door 
 i you know it's gonna be alright 
 don't you know it's three weeks, i'm going insane 
 you know my name and the number you know you know my name 
 ba ba ba ba ba ba pum 
 look up the tears we've cried 
 
 and when i ask you to be mine 
 i can't go on 
 if you drive 
 roll over beethoven 
 roll over beethoven 
 a rocking in two
