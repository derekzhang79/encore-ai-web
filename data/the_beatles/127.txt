 nowhere man, the world is at your command 
 
 he's a real nowhere man 
 sitting in his nowhere land 
 making all his nowhere plans for nobody 
 making all his nowhere plans for nobody 
 with another man 
 that's alright with you. 
 that's alright with you. 
 yeah, that's alright now, mama. 
 just anyway you do. 
 
 
 remember not your age 
 we will never be about the girl who came to stay? 
 she's a woman who loves her man
