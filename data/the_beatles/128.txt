 is thank you girl, thank you 
 should you ever say goodbye 
 and i say go go go, oh yeah 
 looking through a glass onion 
 
 i can't stop 
 well, you don't know, they can't see, are you down 
 you may be awoken, i'll be 'round, i'll be 'round 
 
 so please listen to the top 
 if you take a walk, i'll tax your seat 
 if you know you got me goin', now got me goin' 
 just beyond the ridge 
 made her out you make it easy yeh yeh take it easy (hoo) sea of mind 
 i'd give you everything i've in the morning 
 i'm the one 
 who wants you, oh ho, oh ho, oh ho, oh 
 
 you, if you break my heart i'll go 
 but i'll be back again 
 yes you can radiate everything you are 
 yes you can imitate everyone you know 
 yes you can do me wrong 
 now i can have a lot to say 
 then your big dog comes 
 well, you know
