 who, keep your little hand in mine, girl 
 till the end of time 
 these days are gone alone 
 do you want to know a secret 
 do you promise not to tell, whoa oh, oh 
 
 nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah, nah nah nah, nah nah nah, nah nah 
 nah nah nah 
 
 good for you 
 though she thought i knew the answer 
 well i knew what i said tonight 
 for red is the color that make me feel your love 
 oh what can i do? 
 baby's in black and i'm feeling so upset 
 although i'm so tired i'll have another cigarette 
 and curse sir walter raleigh 
 he one spinal cracker 
 me do 
 always having dirt to play around in 
 
 if you wanna dance with me 
 if you wanna dance with me 
 
 if you need somebody to love 
 just look into my eyes 
 smiles awake you when you rise 
 sleep, pretty darling, do
