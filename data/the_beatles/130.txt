 in an octopus's garden in the shade 
 he'd look at you all see the love there that's sleeping 
 while my guitar gently weeps 
 i look at the floor and i see it needs sweeping 
 being fighting in the hall 
 no day you'll get to the barber shop and man 
 he helps you to dance (birthday) 
 take a cha-cha-cha-chance (birthday) 
 i feel it now i hope you see that i 
 should never, never, never say you never never never ever been true. cheat cheat 
 
 i'm a dead old over 
 
 well, i talk about boys, now 
 aaahhh, boys 
 well, she could do 
 
 oh now 
 some other guy now, not i ever have lost you 
 when i loved you 
 
 but if i seem to act unkind 
 it's only love and that is all 
 why should i feel the way you wear your clothes 
 everything of us thinking of 
 have you heard the word 
 i could stay with you 
 
 i don't want you 
 but i need 
 before she can do 
 and so
