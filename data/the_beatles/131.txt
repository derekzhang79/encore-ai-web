 ja, sie liebt dich 
 und da solltest d'da in her without you 
 
 you should hear what they say 
 
 good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine 
 good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine 
 
 we can work it on out 
 
 you say you got a real solution 
 well you know 
 we all could share 
 when we have another cigarette 
 and curse sir walter raleigh 
 he everything was right, 
 and he never seems to notice 
 
 i wanna be your man 
 love you like no other baby 
 make your mother sigh 
 she's old enough to know better 
 so cry 
 
 with me, love 
 and now she sucks her thumb and wanders 
 by the railroad track 
 oh yeah 
 
 d'do d'do d'do d'do d'do 
 do do do do do do 
 
 d'do d'do d'do
