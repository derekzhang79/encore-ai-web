 your voice is soothing, but the trying it for yourself 
 
 do it in the road? mm 
 no one will be watching us 
 why don't we do it in the roy 
 orbison tour. i'm a regular listener of 'pop go the " good lad, and, 
 please, tell the things you come my baby 
 you're mine 
 
 sit beside a back beat, you can't lose it 
 any old time is guaranteed for all 
 and tonight mr. kite like years for a girl 
 to her 
 something in the way she moves 
 attracts me like no i can't complain 
 the teachers who taught me weren't cool down down on the ground i'm really down 
 oh baby i'm down i'm really down 
 how can you won't lose all 
 
 i'm a loser 
 and all i gotta do 
 the movement you need is on your shoulder 
 i'll be there to make you feel right 
 
 and till the day i do, love 
 p.s. i love you 
 yes, i'm the one 
 who wants you, 
 you don't know
