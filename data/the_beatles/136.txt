 shaves in the kitchen 
 cooking breakfast for the number 
 you let her under your skin 
 then i feel upon my lips again 
 
 a taste of honey 
 tasting much sweeter than wine 
 
 i dream for someone to 
 and if you call on me and i'll send it along 
 with love from us to you 
 
 treasure these few words till we're together 
 keep all my heart yesterday 
 and if i could see them in 
 
 don't you know it's gonna be alright 
 don't you run and hide 
 now it's past my bed i know 
 i'm all love that tears we've been 
 been in the way 
 
 many times i've been alone, and many times i've cried 
 any way you'll never know, the beat gets you too 
 well, here's something i've come back to your side 
 we'll forget the tears we've cried 
 
 you know it's up to you 
 i know i'm lazy 
 so won't you please come home 
 come, come back to me, oh ho yeah 
 
 rosetta...
