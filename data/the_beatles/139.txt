 and now she is mine 
 i'm glad it's your birthday 
 happy birthday to you 
 
 i got a baby won't you please believe me when i beg you on my bended knees 
 if you'll only listen to my pleas 
 is there anything every friend the time, you know and i love 
 
 all you need is love, love 
 love is all you need 
 love is all you need love is all you need 
 love is all and love is to share 
 
 each one believing that love never dies 
 watching her eyes and hoping i'm always on my mind 
 
 a crazy stop, she was the kiss that awoke my heart 
 there lingers still, though we're far apart 
 
 that if i ran away from you 
 talking to the sun 
 if we find it, to try our really don't know 
 
 she's a big teaser, she took me half the way there now 
 she was a day tripper, a sunday driver yeah 
 it took me so long 
 on our way home 
 we're going home
