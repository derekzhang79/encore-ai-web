 you could know the ways of heaven 
 
 i've got the sack 
 monday morning, turning back 
 so alright 
 alright, alright 
 
 the eagle picks my eye 
 the worm he licks my bone 
 i feel so suicidal 
 just like dylan's mr. jones 
 lonely wanna die 
 if you won't see her no more 
 
 she does for me, oooh 
 
 when i'm with you i want you 
 i want you to be my bride 
 run and dance to her husband daddy our baby's gone 
 and he never shows his feelings 
 
 but my love you whisper soft and true 
 darling i love you 
 seems to be free 
 when the rain comes they run and hide their heads 
 
 you know it's up to you 
 
 if i could wait forever, i'm not what i appear to be 
 
 of all the love i have won or have lost 
 the fool on the hill 
 i tell you man he living there 
 
 oh i will return, yes i will return 
 
 lay down
