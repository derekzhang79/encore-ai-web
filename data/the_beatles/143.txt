 when i'm in the middle of the celebrations 
 i break down 
 
 out of college, money spent 
 see no future, pay no rent 
 all i can hear, i me mine 
 all good children go to heaven 
 one two three four five six seven 
 all good children go to heaven 
 one two three four five six seven 
 all good children go to heaven 
 one two three four five six seven 
 all good children go to heaven 
 one two three four five six seven 
 all good children go to heaven 
 one two three four five six seven 
 all good children go to heaven 
 one two three four five six seven 
 all good children go to heaven 
 one two three four five six seven 
 all good children go to heaven 
 one two three four five six seven 
 all good children go to heaven 
 one sweet dream 
 i wonder you and i see no reason to change the world 
 but that she was meant just for me, oh, oh
