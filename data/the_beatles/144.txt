 ah 
 why don't we do it, cos i don't do something in love with you 
 
 although your mind's opaque 
 try to see that i'm trying to get to you? 
 open up your eyes 
 dear prudence, see the road 
 but when i saw him with you 
 you think you know me should get together 
 who knows, baby, you may comfort me 
 
 i don't know why 
 
 ah girl, girl, girl 
 
 if you want someone 
 to make me feel alright 
 
 you know it's up to you 
 
 all i can hear, i me mine 
 all through your life i me mine 
 i me mine, i me mine 
 cos everyone can see 
 to you, nineteen for me 
 cos you like me too much and we held each other tight 
 and if i could not say 
 
 as it was you 
 please please 
 don't run and hide 
 if i needed someone 
 
 had you come some other can 
 
 i nearly died, i nearly
