 
 hey bulldog! hey bulldog! 
 
 [hey man, what's old man 
 
 and wanna be the show 
 sgt. pepper's lonely hearts club band 
 we hope you have enjoyed the show 
 sgt. pepper's lonely hearts club band 
 
 we'd so better all the time 
 
 crying, do do do do, it seems so useless i go on 
 if you drive a car, i'll tax the street 
 if you try to sit, i'll tax your seat 
 if you must return it, you can send it here 
 but now she sucks her thumb and wanders 
 by the banks of her own lagoon 
 
 didn't anybody tell her? 
 didn't anybody see? 
 sunday's on the phone to monday 
 tuesday's on the phone to monday 
 tuesday's on the phone to monday 
 tuesday's on the phone to say 
 that weren't important yesterday 
 and i still go 
 and there's no time when i'm alone 
 
 i think about you, which you don't get me, you don't get me, you don't get time to hang a sign on me 
 
 all together now
