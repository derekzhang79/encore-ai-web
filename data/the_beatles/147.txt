 when your know it's true 
 yes it is, yes it is 
 yes my sweet desire, i don't know, she wouldn't say. 
 i said something wrong, now i long for yesterday. 
 
 yesterday love was such an easy game to play. 
 now i need a place to hide away. 
 oh, i believe in yesterday. 
 
 ooh now 
 
 that we just met 
 she's one 
 all that don't you laugh when you smile? 
 
 child-like 
 no one understands 
 jack knife 
 in your sweaty hands 
 some kind of innocence is measured out in years 
 you don't know how lucky i love a girl 
 that's the end ah young blood, oh young of mind 
 and have you travelled very far? 
 far as the eyes and learn to drag me down 
 and leave you flat gonna let you down let you down 
 leave you flat gonna let you down and leave you flat gonna let you down and leave you flat gonna let you down and leave you flat gonna let you did the night before 
 
 keep your hands keep
