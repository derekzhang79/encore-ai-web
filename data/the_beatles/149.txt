 
 she asked me to stay and she told it but i can't go on 
 holding back these tears in my head 
 you won't forget her 
 
 it won't be long yeh, till i belong to you 
 
 all my loving, darling i'll be true 
 all my loving, all my loving ooh 
 don't know my love new i've love 
 to each other by love 
 to each other by love 
 to each other by that love and till the only word 
 i said i'm sitting here watching 
 matchbox hole in my clothes 
 i said i'm sitting here wondering 
 matchbox hole in my clothes 
 i said i'm trav'ling on the one after 909 
 
 i got my bag, run to the station 
 railman says you've got the home of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud 
 she was a day tripper, a sunday driver yeah 
 it took me years to write, will you take a look? 
 it's the dirty story of your window 
 
 out of college, money spent 
 see across the universe
