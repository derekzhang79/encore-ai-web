 now, junior, behave yourself 
 
 going tell your mama 
 hide the world going by my window 
 you could know where the mighty tiger lies 
 about another man 
 i wanna be your man, i wanna be your man 
 love you like no other lover 
 something in the way she knows 
 that i don't need no other lover 
 something in the rain 
 
 oh, on my saturday 
 i might girls know it's up to you 
 
 since you left me, i'm so alone 
 now you're coming, you're coming home 
 
 i don't want you 
 but i love you still 
 will i wait a lonely lifetime 
 if i do that i'm ready to leave 
 'cause you're making me feel like you gotta move a round 
 but you'll have to have them all pulled out 
 after the savoy truffle 
 
 cool cherry cream, nice apple tart 
 i feel that ice is slowly melting 
 and i'm the only one 
 
 you say you got a real solution 
 well, you know 
 we all want
