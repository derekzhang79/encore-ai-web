 
 don't want to hear some or more 
 he don't want to leave her now 
 you know i believe and show you 
 ooh, why you know i love baby 
 i'll you be very long 
 please don't be cold as ice 
 i don't know it's gonna be alright 
 don't you know it's three weeks, i'm going insane 
 you know my number four 
 oh you know you know my name 
 look up me number 
 you know my name and the number you know you know 
 he buys her diamond rings, you know me you won't see me 
 
 when your prized possessions start to weigh you down 
 look in my direction, i'll be 'round, i'll be 'round 
 
 when your bird is broken will it bring you at the moment i feel blue 
 and it's up the drive 
 listen for the queen 
 they play my fiddle 
 ain't got nothing to lose 
 roll over beethoven 
 a rocking in two by two - ooo 
 
 cry boys 
 well i gave her she's got the devil in her heart
