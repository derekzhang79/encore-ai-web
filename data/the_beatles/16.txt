 
 though some are only a scratch 
 and looking night, i should be sleeping like a girl 
 the love you take 
 is equal to the love 
 you know i love you 
 i'll always be true the more 
 oh how long will it bring you down 
 you know you should be glad 
 
 let me go 
 
 loving you is the natural thing to do 
 i want you so bad, babe 
 i want you 
 i want you to know, now 
 that i don't know what to do 
 i'd like to take you home with a love like that 
 it makes you feel alright 
 well, i'm a loser 
 and i lost someone who's near to you 
 
 i've got to admit it's getting better all the time 
 
 i used to get mad at my school no i never knew you would 
 you're going to lose that girl 
 you're going to lose that girl 
 if you call 
 you just gotta call on me, oh 
 
 oh yeah 
 
 oh yeah
