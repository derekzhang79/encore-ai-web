 and moscow girls dream on me away 
 and from your beam you made my dream 
 and from the eyes if you saw my love 
 don't forget me martha my dear

 you know you know my name as nothing today 
 
 you can't cry over only you 
 
 in penny lane from the gallery 
 know you can't lose it 
 any old time you use it 
 it's got a back beat, you can't lose it 
 any old time you use it

 and you know you should be glad 
 with a love like that
