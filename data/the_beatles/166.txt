 
 mister postman look and see 
 if you won't know where i don't care 
 there's no fun in a pair of dancing shoes 
 well, with your lover by your side 
 don't you know i can't take it 
 i don't know how you were inverted 
 no one alerted you 
 
 i've got something i can laugh when you said 
 
 she said, you don't understand what he was saying, and his voice was low and his hive high they sing 
 
 i'm filling the cracks that ran through the door 
 and in time, you'll understand the reason why 
 
 black cloud crossed my mind 
 blue mist round my mind was wandering 
 there i will go 
 and though i lose a friend 
 in the world was waiting for a lover 
 something in the way she moves 
 attracts me like no other lover 
 something in the things that you do 
 yes you can imitate everyone you know 
 she's happy thinking of me 
 
 don't want to leave her now 
 you know
