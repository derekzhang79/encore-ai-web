 a day of within 
 it is not dying, it is not 
 but all the fun we had 
 we can work it out 
 
 life is very short, and there's no time when i'm alone 
 
 i begged you knew the place 
 gee it's good to be back home 
 leave it up to you, the choice. i know that i just stuttered yip yip boom 
 yes you can penetrate the place 
 gee it's good news 
 but you'll have to have them all pulled out 
 after the savoy truffle 
 
 cool cherry cream, nice apple tart 
 i feel as though 
 you ought to know 
 that i've been good 
 as good as i can go 
 
 her and they called it me and dance with me 
 if i needed someone 
 
 had you come some other can 
 but if you ever even try 
 i wouldn't worm 
 still my guitar gently weeps 
 i look at the floor and i see it needs sweeping 
 what? what? 
 
 everybody had a good time 
 
 you better run
