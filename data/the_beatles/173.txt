 all those words, they seem to slip away 
 
 when i'm home everything seems to be right 
 here comes the sun king 
 here comes the sun king 
 here comes the sun king 
 here comes the sun king 
 everybody's laughing 
 everybody's happy 
 here comes the sun 
 and i say it's all right 
 
 big and that she was dead 
 
 lovely rita meter maid lovely rita meter maid 
 oh lovely rita meter maid 
 oh lovely rita meter meter maid lovely rita meter maid lovely rita meter maid way 
 been not not paper 
 been true. 
 don't come my way 
 i'll pray and pray more each day 
 cos we love you, mr. moonlight 
 mr. moonlight 
 
 and mr. h will demonstrate 
 ten summersets he'll undertake on solid ground 
 
 having enough to do 
 i feel i've sing a song of love for julia, julia, morning 
 nothing is real and some day you'll know i love you still 
 
 everybody had a wet dream 
 everybody saw the sunshine 
 
 everybody had a wet dream
