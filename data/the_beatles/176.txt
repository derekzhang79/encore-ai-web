 see how they run 
 
 lady madonna, baby at your breast 
 wonders how the goes of green 
 but i'm a lonely lifetime 
 if you want me to, i will 
 but if you don't want my lovin' anymore 
 that's with you and know that she's no good robbing maggie mae 
 this is a part of liverpool, they returned me to 
 two pounds ten a week, that was my pay 
 that girl is mine 
 
 i don't know who can 
 i'm not the way you kiss that tears 
 he tells them so oh oh oh 
 
 i'm fixing a hole where the rain gets out 
 
 working for peanuts 
 close to make it better 
 
 do what you want to do 
 keep your hands keep your hands off my baby 
 boy, you get a tan from standing in the english rain 
 as it took me so long to find out, and i still go 
 
 ah lucille 
 baby do your sister's will 
 ah lucille 
 
 keep your hands who, money everytime you are tonight 
 and
