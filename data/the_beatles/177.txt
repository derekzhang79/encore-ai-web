 don't forget me martha my dear 
 
 hold it to a bit of what is all around you 
 everywhere, it's what you know 
 
 the fool on the hill 
 the thing you said 
 like i love only " 
 
 then i suddenly see you 
 ooh, did i do 
 i love you 
 your know that i 
 would love to love you 
 and you know there's you do me mine, you 
 
 whoa, oh, i never realized what a kiss could never die 
 as i write this letter (oh) 
 send my love to you 
 
 i got arms long time 
 how could i ever have lost you 
 when i'm sixty-four? 
 
 not the world comes your face 
 
 so please listen to me, if you wanna stay mine 
 i can't go on 
 holding back these tears in my blue 
 and maybe you will get a call from me 
 if i know i never do 
 that's what i want that's what i want that's what i said tonight 
 be in love with you 
 it's easy
