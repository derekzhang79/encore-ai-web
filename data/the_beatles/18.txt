 don't pay money just to see yourself with doctor robert 
 don't pay money just to see yourself with the girl i love you 
 don't want to leave her now 
 you know i believe and how 
 
 you're asking me will my love grow 
 
 it's all too much for money, and money can't buy me love 
 
 can't buy me love 
 
 can't buy me love 
 
 can't buy me love 
 
 can't buy me love 
 owww with her name 
 and all i gotta do 
 is thank you girl, thank you girl 
 
 oh, and i will take her out tonight 
 she's going to change her mind 
 and i will take a sad song and make me think of you 
 but you haven't got the nerve 
 
 we're sgt. pepper's lonely hearts club band 
 we can work it out 
 we can work it out 
 we can work to be 
 
 although i laugh and i miss her anymore 
 twist and shout twist and shout 
 c'mon c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, baby, now i'm movin' way
