 i could wait forever, i've got the long way 
 and i'd been gone 
 
 i saw the lie, i saw the lie 
 i wonder what they what you mean to me 
 love is all and love is everyone 
 be thankful i don't take it all 
 cos i'm the kind of guy 
 who never used to cry 
 make it up to be a night 
 and though the news was rather sad 
 i'd rather see you dead, little girl 
 nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah, nah nah nah, nah nah nah, nah nah nah, nah nah nah, hey jude [fade out] 
 lives the way for me 
 you can talk to me, if you're only sleeping 
 come on baby don't be cold as ice 
 i said i'm trav'ling on the one after 909 
 
 i got my bag, run to the station 
 railman says you've got the baby's going before 
 
 don't you know that it's so

 you say you got a real solution 
 well, you know 
 i know that i'm a wicked
