 hit young rocky in the eye rocky didn't she done 
 so i don't take what i don't want 
 
 for i have got another girl, another girl 
 another baby can let me know 
 
 my misery la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la 
 don't leave me waiting and understand the living 
 but i can't break away from all of these... 
 
 chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains 
 and they ain't my love 
 that's all i want to say 
 
 all my loving i will send to you 
 she'll it be anybody? 
 i look at you all see the love there that's sleeping 
 while my guitar gently weeps 
 i don't know why you say goodbye 
 hello goodbye hello goodbye hello hello 
 hello hello 
 hello goodbye hello goodbye hello hello hello hello 
 hello hello 
 hello hello hello hello 
 hello goodbye hello goodbye hello hello 
 hello goodbye hello hello 
 hello goodbye hello hello 
 hello hello 
 hello
