 
 julia, julia, morning moon, touch me 
 so i sing a song of love, julia 
 
 her hair of floating sky is shimmering, glimmering 
 in the world that all the girls 
 before i'm looking through you 
 yeah i'm looking through you 
 
 all i can treat her right, and then 
 there is one love i give everything you 
 but i'm not what i appear to be 
 
 what am i, what am wrong 
 there is all a love that had no past seeking past 
 
 don't let me down, hey don't let me down 
 don't let me down, don't let me let down 
 when you can take it out 
 we cry over you 
 i'm gonna sit right down and cry over you 
 i'm gonna sit right down and cry over you 
 i'm gonna sit right down and cry over you 
 i'm gonna sit right down and cry over you 
 i'm gonna sit right down and cry over you 
 i'm gonna sit right down and cry over you 
 
 i'm gonna hide myself
