 please don't be afraid 
 you were perverted too 
 i don't know 
 that i've been good 
 maxwell stands alone 
 painting testimonial pictures ohh oh oh oh 
 rose and valerie screaming from the gallery 
 the worm he licks my bone 
 i feel so suicidal 
 even hate my rock 'n' roll 
 wanna die yeah wanna die 
 if you were there? 
 why don't we do it in the road? 
 
 ooh 
 you let me be your little dog 
 till your big dog comes 
 in the sun 
 
 julia, julia, morning moon, touch
