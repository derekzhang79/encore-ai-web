 it's easy cos i thought i just had to be in my dreams 
 tonight? 
 
 [drum solo] 
 
 [guitar solos] 
 
 and in the mood they take me much, alright 
 let me hear you say the words i long to hear 
 darling when you're near 
 words of love you whisper soft and true 
 darling i love you 
 and i'm always thinking of you 
 
 and in her eyes you see nothing 
 no sign of love behind her tears 
 still you still can recall 
 some day, i me (ooh) 
 
 i'll be on my way oh 
 i'll be on my way 
 
 just one more thing, girl 
 you took my love for you so 
 and i hear them say 
 
 hey bulldog! hey bulldog! hey bulldog! 
 
 hey bulldog! hey bulldog! 
 
 [hey man, what's that noise? 
 
 woof! 
 
 well early in the morning 
 waiting for the tides of time 
 but now her man 
 
 well his mama told him
