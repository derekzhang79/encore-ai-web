 getting so much better all the time 
 all the children sing 
 
 hey, bungalow bill 
 what did you kill, bungalow bill? 
 hey, bungalow bill 
 what did you kill, bungalow bill? 
 hey, bungalow bill 
 what did you kill, bungalow bill? 
 
 help me if you can, i'm feeling down 
 you may think the chords are going 
 they're going to crucify me 
 
 give the word a chance to say 
 that the word is just the way 
 it's the word i'm thinking of 
 and the only word is love 
 i'm sure to fall in love with you 
 
 and take you sad because the rain comes they run and hide my love 
 i don't know, she wouldn't say. 
 i said something wrong, now i long for yesterday. 
 
 yesterday love was such an easy game to play. 
 now i find i've changed my mind and opened up the doors 
 
 well they know it's true 
 yes it is, gun happiness bang, bang, shoot, shoot 
 happiness just a half a mile 
 from the mississippi bridge
