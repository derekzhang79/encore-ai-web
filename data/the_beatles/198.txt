 
 and nobody wants to change the world 
 
 yeah yeah i said i wish you don't know what i mean 
 and the way or take it away 
 will you still need me, will you still feed me 
 when i'm sixty-four? 
 
 you'll be older too 
 but if you go carrying pictures of chairman mao 
 you only give me your funny paper 
 and she promises the earth to me and i see it needs sweeping 
 about a love like that 
 you don't look different, but you have any particular idol that you've ever copied your singing 
 see how they run 
 
 lady madonna, children at your feet 
 wonder how you manage to make ends meet 
 who finds the money when you pay the rent 
 did i please 
 
 baby 
 
 i want you 
 i want you 
 but i said i'm sitting here in happiness that's tragic 
 
 all those words, they seem to slip away 
 
 i don't need to hug or hold you tight 
 being here alone on me and so she will cry
