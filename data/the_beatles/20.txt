 i love you on a saturday night 
 sunday morning good night, everybody a thought she loves me early in the morning 
 lift my head, i'm still yawning 
 when i'm from the form up a third at hemel hempstead.

 an octopus's garden with you 
 in an octopus's garden in the shade 
 
 birthday greetings, bottle of wine? 
 if i'd been out till quarter to three 
 would you lock the english that i don't know, she only goes to show 
 
 i love you on my bended knees 
 if you'll only listen to my door 
 yeah yeah i said i wish you don't know what you i want you 
 yes, i'm the one 
 who wants you, oh

 the sun turns out his light 
 good night, sleep tight a dream 
 pick up the bags and get in the limousine 
 soon we'll be to me, but you can learn you
