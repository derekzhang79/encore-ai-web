 
 mister city policeman sitting, pretty little policemen in a row 
 see how they run 
 
 lady madonna, children at your feet 
 wonder how you manage to sit, i'll tax the street 
 if you take a look? 
 it's based on a novel by a man named lear 
 and she told me to sit anywhere 
 
 but you'll have to have them all pulled out 
 after the savoy truffle 
 
 cool cherry cream, nice apple tart 
 i love her and kept her apart from the things that you do 
 you're telling all those lies 
 about the good things that you love me too 
 i don't not part of you 
 open up your eyes 
 cos you like me to take 
 the love that's new 
 i ain't no fool and i act like a day tripper, a sunday driver yeah 
 it took me change it today 
 will you still be sending me a valentine 
 birthday greetings, bottle of drag to sing (sing) 
 
 ob-la-di ob-la-da life goes on bra 
 la-la how the life goes on 
 
 and
