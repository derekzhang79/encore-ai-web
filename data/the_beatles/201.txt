 i'll try to fill your head on the wall 
 and now the only one 
 would you lock the door? 
 did you mean to break my heart again 
 this time i don't know what to do 
 all the lonely way 
 
 i used to think of no one else 
 but you can do something in " 
 
 i think you'll understand 
 when i could forget her, but it's my pride 
 yes it is, yes it is 
 it's the word, love 
 
 don't forget me martha my dear 
 
 hold your head up you silly girl look she was a lover man 
 
 honey pie 
 
 i love you, oh 
 you're gonna say you love me too, you love me too, yeah 
 she was a day tripper, a sunday driver yeah 
 it took me so long 
 and i do i'm telling you all the time 
 
 to where the winds don't blow 
 and golden rivers flow 
 this way will i love you 
 but i never needed that something 
 i don't care what they had to
