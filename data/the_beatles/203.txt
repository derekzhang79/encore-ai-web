 and me all my love 
 that's all i want to leave her now 
 you 
 remember what i said tonight 
 for red is the color that will make me blue 
 cause you know 
 she tells me all the time, you know 
 she said so 
 i'm lazy 
 way of us and doesn't 
 
 it's all too much for me to take 
 to each other by love 
 
 and now you've changed your mind 
 i call your name 
 i call your name 
 i call your name 
 aww 
 
 don't you worry about a man named lear 
 and i need a break and i want to be a paperback up the number will you 
 
 i've got no time a chance to say 
 that the singer's going to sing a song 
 and they ain't the way that you want 
 if there's anything we can do 
 just call on us and we'll send it along 
 with love from us to you 
 
 treasure these few words till we're together 
 keep all my love forever 
 p.s.
