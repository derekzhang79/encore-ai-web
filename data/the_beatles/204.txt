 some music 
 pray i'm sitting singing songs for everyone 
 
 me used to take a walk and look for her 
 
 she's got the devil in her heart 
 no she's an angel sent to me 
 tell me why you cried, and why you cried, and why you lied to me 
 
 honey pie you are making me crazy 
 i'm in love with you 
 
 there were birds with my guy 
 i could wait forever, i've got time, i've got time, i've got time, i've got time, i've got time, i've got time, i've got time, i've got time, i've got time, i've got time, i've got time, i've got time, i've got time, i've got time, i've got time, i've got time, i've got time, i've got time, i've got time, i've got time, i've got time, i've got time, i've got time, i've got time, i've got time, i've got time, i've got time, i've got time, i've got time, i've got time, i've got time, i've got time 
 
 sometimes i get to can't not be 
 if i could forget her, but it's my pride
