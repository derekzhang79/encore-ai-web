 but i know who placed the call 
 i can't hide 
 i can't hide 
 i can't hide 
 
 yeah, that's alright with you. 
 that's alright with you. and we'll send it along 
 with love from us to you 
 
 treasure these few words till or two 
 and i wish everything i've to see 
 
 so please listen to the music playing in your head 
 hold my face 
 
 so please listen to me, if you wanna stay mine 
 i can't help my feelings, i'll go out of my mind 
 i'm in love with you 
 and these memories lose their meaning 
 when i think of all the times i tried so hard to leave her 
 she will never make it alone 
 pride was really nothing else i'd rather do 
 i've discovered i'm in love with her and i feel fine 
 
 i'm so glad you came your baby 
 i wanna be your man 
 love you like no other baby 
 like no other can 
 love you like no other lover 
 and from the world and
