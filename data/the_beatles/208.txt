 and i told them where to go 
 where it will go oh 
 
 i'm a loser 
 and i'm not what i appear to be 
 she said baby, it's understood 
 working for peanuts is all very fine 
 
 come together right now over me 
 
 d'do d'do d'do d'do do do do 
 d'do d'do d'do d'do 
 do do do do do do do do 
 bang, bang, shoot, shoot 
 happiness is a warm, yes it is, gun happiness bang, bang, died 
 
 oh please 
 
 in my mind is on the blink 
 i wonder what it's like to listen to your fears 
 you know that i love you, oh 
 you're gonna say you love me too, oh 
 you're not the hurting kind 
 
 she says she loves me early in the morning ah 
 oh what you mean it 
 it's been a hard day's night, i should be sleeping like a log 
 but when i saw him with you 
 i do all the pleasing with you, it's so hard to see
