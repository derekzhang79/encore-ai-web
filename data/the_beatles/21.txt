 
 everywhere there's lots of piggies 
 living piggy lives 
 i wanna be your man 
 you know you made me cry 
 i see no reason to change mine 
 i cry cos i really more 
 she said baby, it's understood 
 working for peanuts 
 but it's so hard loving you 
 yes you can start to make it better 
 
 and anytime you if i feel that ice is slowly melting 
 like a rolling stone 
 like the fbi and the cia 
 and the bbc, bb king 
 and doris day 
 matt busby 
 dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it 
 
 [that was can you dig a call from me 
 so i sing a song of love, julia 
 julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me 
 
 i don't know why you say goodbye 
 hello hello
