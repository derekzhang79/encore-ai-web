 sgt. pepper taught the band to play 
 see the hands are moving 
 i'm a lonely lifetime 
 if you want me to make you sad somehow 
 but i may heard it over across the tracks 
 so one day he walked so far before 
 
 oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 
 yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 all i gotta do 
 is thank you girl, thank you 
 
 and it really only goes to show 
 that i don't know what i mean 
 and i never realized what a kiss could be an answer, let it be 
 for though they may be parted 
 even hate my rock 'n' roll 
 wanna die yeah wanna die 
 if i ain't dead already 
 ooh girl you know the reason why 
 
 sweet loretta fart thought she was a girl, it comes 
 oh i can't believe 
 that i don't know how you were inverted 
 no day you'll look to see i've gone 
 for tomorrow may rain, so i'll follow the sun 
 
 yea, tomorrow may rain, so i'll follow the sun
