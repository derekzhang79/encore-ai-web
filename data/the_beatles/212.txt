 the magical mystery tour 
 roll up and that's an invitation), roll up for the mystery tour 
 the magical mystery tour is hoping to take you away 
 hoping to take you away 
 hoping to take you away 
 get the horn by the door 
 the folks dancing there are all shook up 
 
 after all this time i will try to show that i'm 
 not trying to pretend 
 
 i wanna be your man 
 i wanna be your man, i wanna be your man 
 love you like no other baby 
 like no other can 
 love you like no other lover 
 something in the middle of the celebrations 
 i break down
