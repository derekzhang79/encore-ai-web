 the english army had he as can be 
 just sees what he wants to do 
 and he never gives an answer 
 see how they run 
 
 lady madonna, baby at your breast 
 wonders how you manage to make you sad because the wind is high...aaaaaaaahhhh 
 so take a chance with me 
 baby you're a rich man 
 baby you're a rich man 
 baby you're a rich man 
 baby you're a rich man 
 baby you're a rich man 
 baby you're a rich man 
 baby you're a rich man 
 baby you're a rich man 
 baby, gonna change my world 
 
 images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes 
 they call me on and more for the girl of the dark 
 some kind of innocence is measured out in years 
 you don't know how lucky you are boy 
 we can work it out 
 we can work it out 
 we can work it away 
 don't let me the way 
 
 many times i've been alone, and many times i've cried 
 any way you'll never know,
