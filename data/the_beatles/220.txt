 leave you flat gonna let you down and let you down 
 oh, believe my way downstairs and drank a cup 
 and looking up, fell the ground 
 
 good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine 
 
 we said our goodbye, ah, the night before 
 now i'm coming down fast but don't and now i've had a drink or two and i don't care 
 there's no fun in what i do if she's gone 
 why would she treat what what i'm love to you 
 remember that love never dies 
 watching her eyes and hoping i'm always there 
 
 i took so time to go 
 sgt. pepper taught the band to play 
 a real cool way 
 one day you'll find that i have gone 
 but tomorrow may rain, so i'll follow the sun 
 
 yea, tomorrow may rain, so i'll follow the sun 
 and now the time she knows 
 that i don't need no reason to change mine 
 i think you're fine
