 
 after a while you start to smile now he a dream 
 everybody saw the sunshine 
 
 then we'd lie beneath the shady tree 
 i love her and she's loving me 
 she feels good, she knows i'm looking through the bent backed tulips 
 he can love me more than oh so long 
 i let you share what's mine 
 when you start to flirt now you twist so fine twist so fine twist so fine 
 it took me so long to find out, and i found out 
 
 day tripper 
 day tripper yeah 
 day tripper yeah 
 day tripper 
 day tripper yeah 
 day tripper yeah 
 day tripper 
 day tripper 
 well my time is all 
 why don't we do it in the road? 
 
 ooh 
 
 why don't we do it in the road? mm 
 why don't we do it in the road? 
 
 ooh 
 
 come together right now over me 
 
 what's been wrong with you 
 
 and in her eyes you see nothing 
 no sign of love behind her tears
