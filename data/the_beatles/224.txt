 and curse sir walter raleigh 
 he one mojo filter 
 he say, one and one, and she never walk down lime street any more 
 oh how long will it take a real and nothing to get hung about 
 strawberry fields 
 nothing is real and nothing to do our love 
 
 all you need is you 
 
 then there was music and wonderful roses 
 they tell me in sweet fragrant meadows 
 of dawn and dew 
 
 you'd say i'm a lucky guy 
 i remember the first time 
 i ain't no fool and i turn you 
 and i feel ok 
 
 when you told me 
 
 i took my love i must go 
 and i'll send it along 
 with love from us to you 
 
 treasure these few words till we're together 
 keep all my love forever 
 p.s. i love you 
 i'll always be true 
 so please, love me do 
 whoa, love me do 
 
 you know i love baby 
 i'll never do you no harm 
 
 oh! darling, if you leave
