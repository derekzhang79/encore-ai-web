 all she needs is the stars up your hearts and sing me a song 
 so dirty man 
 his sister pam works in a shop 
 she said, i may be alright 
 don't you know it's three weeks, i'm going insane 
 you can't be afraid 
 you don't let me down 
 it's alright 
 
 baby 
 
 i don't know how you were inverted 
 no one alerted you 
 
 but if you go carrying pictures of chairman mao 
 you don't get time to hang a sign on me 
 
 and now you've changed your mind 
 i see no reason to change your head 
 you tell me it's the institution 
 but you don't get to only you 
 so hold me tight, tonight, tonight, 
 it's not to go around explaining to your wife that you're not divorced and all that sort of things? 
 [john:] no, she knows she's looking fine 
 i'm so proud to know him 
 they can see that isn't shown 
 doing you too much for money, and money can't buy me love 
 
 can't buy me love
