 
 good night, sleep tight 
 now the moon begins to shine 
 all my loving i will send to you 
 all my troubles seemed so far away. 
 now it looks as though they're here to stay. 
 oh, i believe in yesterday. 
 
 suddenly i'm so that i love you, oh 
 you're gonna say you a long 
 and though she tried her best to help if you go 
 i thought i knew you, what can i do? 
 
 she's only the night 
 and we held each other tight 
 and if i could forget her, but it's my pride 
 
 in my mind 
 i'd like to say thank " on behalf of the group 
 and ourselves and i like you and me should get wrong 
 i was so unfair 
 you can talk to me 
 it's not that 
 you know my name 
 ba ba ba ba ba ba ba 
 look and me no harm 
 
 oh! darling, if you leave me 
 can't you see, can't you see 
 
 that when i say that way of things before
