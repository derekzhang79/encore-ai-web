 
 well, it's past 
 you don't get time to hang a sign on me 
 
 and all i gotta do is call and i'll be glad 
 
 i can't believe that she'll ever ever go 
 not when she hugs and says she loves you 
 and you know it's true 
 cos she was dead 
 so come on pretty hand 
 i wanna hold your hand 
 i ever had 
 
 i can't believe it's happened to me 
 i said move over honey i'm travelling on that line 
 i said move over honey i'm travelling on that line 
 i said move over honey i'm travelling on that line 
 i said move over honey i'm travelling on that line 
 i said move over honey i'm travelling on that line 
 i said move over honey i'm travelling on that line 
 i said i wish i knew you would 
 
 sitting in his room 
 
 here comes the sun king 
 here comes the sun king 
 everybody's laughing 
 everybody's happy 
 if you're down i'm here to show everybody i can't done 
 leave it
