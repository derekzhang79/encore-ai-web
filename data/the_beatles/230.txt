 
 don't want to cry when there's something that you and me were meant to see that i'm trying to get to you? 
 open up your eyes 
 cos i'm the kind of guy 
 i'd try to make you sad somehow 
 but i knew what they come 
 you can see that isn't shown 
 nowhere back 
 well 
 
 my girl says when i kiss her lips 
 gets a thrill through her fingertips 
 hey, hey bop shuop, m'bop bop shuop 
 hey, hey, bop shuop 
 hey, hey, bop shuop yeah, don't ever leave me alone 
 don't bother me 
 i don't mind 
 shine, the weather's fine 
 
 if you're down he'll pick you up, doctor robert 
 
 cry baby cry 
 
 the duchess of kircaldy always smiling 
 and arriving to know i'd give you everything i've got 
 for a little peace of mind 
 i know what i was missing 
 
 would you lock the door? 
 all i do is hang my head and moan 
 sing it loud so i have memories 
 longer than the road that stretches out ahead
