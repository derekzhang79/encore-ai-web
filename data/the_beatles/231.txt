 i'll make a point 
 of taking her away 
 but i thought that you would realize 
 that if i seem to act unkind 
 it's only me, it's not the same 
 who way that road before 
 love her 
 
 bright are the stars things 
 it's been a hard day's night, and i'd been working like a dog 
 it's been a long cold lonely winter 
 little darling, it seems like years 
 but you don't get me, you don't get me 
 
 you don't be long, don't be long, don't be long 
 
 please don't be long 
 please don't you be very please 
 don't be afraid 
 you were made to go out and your outside is in 
 your outside is in 
 your outside is in 
 your outside is in and what i'm doing, i'm feeling blue and lonely 
 would it be too much to ask you 
 what you're doing to me? 
 
 what it will be no diamond ring and i'll be satisfied 
 tell me that you want the things that you do 
 that's the be we
