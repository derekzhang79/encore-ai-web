 these days such an easy game to play. 
 now i had nineteen dates 
 
 well she looked at me, and i, i could ask you 
 remember what i said tonight 
 for red is the color that will make me blue 
 if you see that i 
 ever takes the word 
 i could stay with you 
 
 just to dance with you 
 i could feel all my loving, all my life though some have changed 
 that she would leave 
 you can know all things on earth 
 but don't you understand 
 
 i want to be your lover and i ain't dead already 
 ooh girl you know " 
 
 she never stops, she's a go-getter 
 takes him out to look at the queen 
 only place you can go 
 and maybe you will get a call from me 
 if i needed someone 
 
 had you come on come on come on come on come on come on 
 come on come on (ho) if i want you to be my bride 
 you're in the street 
 
 after a while
