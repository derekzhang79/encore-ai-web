 friday night arrives without a suitcase 
 sunday morning creeping like a girl 
 the jokey folks they had the jamboree 
 the band starts to play 
 a real cool time 
 not comes the sun 
 the skys are tied 
 i am the walrus, goo goo g' joob 
 
 please stop the band. oh, that's splendid and now, what 
 lay down your arms soldier of love 
 and surrender to me sha la, la yeah sha la la 
 use yourself up with her in jackboots and kilt 
 she's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt 
 she's the kind of a girl that makes the rock and roll music all night 
 well, i saw her yesterday love baby 
 i'll never do you no harm 
 
 oh! darling, if you take a look? 
 it's based on a novel by a man named lear 
 and i need a break and i too oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah
