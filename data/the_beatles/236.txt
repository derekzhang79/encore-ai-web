 
 don't let me let down 
 can make you feel 
 but i need a break and something 
 i wanna hold your hand 
 
 honey don't get everything it's true 
 what it like to be 
 
 it's all too much for me to take 
 is equal to the love 
 you should see polythene pam 
 yeah yeah yeah 
 
 she says she loves me early in the morning 
 lift my head, i'm still yawning 
 when i'm in the middle of the door 
 and as he gives it to her she begins to sing (sing) by 
 when i feel that something 
 i wanna hold your hand 
 
 i don't want to say that i've been unhappy with you 
 but, as from today, well, i've seen somebody that's new 
 i ain't no fool and i don't take what i don't want you down 
 
 sometimes i wish i knew you well, you know my name 
 look up me number 
 that's alright my mama, anyway you do. 
 that's alright, that's alright my mama, anyway you do. 
 
 well, some rotten deal
