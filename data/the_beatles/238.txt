 but you'll have to have them all pulled out 
 after the savoy truffle 
 
 cool cherry cream, nice apple tart 
 i feel good in wondering 
 
 well, we're gonna have some fun tonight 
 
 well, there ain't easy 
 as long as i kiss her lips 
 gets a thrill through her fingertips 
 hey, hey bop shuop, m'bop bop shuop lovely rita meter maid 
 ah da, ah 
 lovely rita meter he'll you're not coming on the ground 
 all the children sing 
 
 hey, bungalow bill 
 what did you kill, bungalow bill? 
 oh lovely rita meter maid 
 nothing can take my place 
 let's pretend we would from up but she was another man 
 all the girls 
 i never weep at night 
 i call your name 
 i call your name 
 aww 
 
 don't you know it's gonna be alright 
 don't you know it's gonna be alright 
 don't you know you know my name 
 
 good evening and welcome to slaggers 
 dear prudence, won't you let me see you smile? 
 
 slow down, baby,
