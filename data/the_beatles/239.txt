 this boy wants you back again 
 
 this boy wouldn't mind the pain 
 would always feel the same 
 
 love you forever 
 where i belong 
 see the people standing there 
 who disagree and never win 
 and wonder why they don't get in my door 
 
 everybody's trying to be my love 
 don't forget me martha my dear 
 
 don't you think the joker laughs at the turnstile 
 the girl with kaleidoscope eyes 
 
 and in the end 
 the love you take 
 is equal to the love 
 i'll be here 
 
 a love that should have lasted years 
 
 come on, give me fever 
 put your little hand in hand 
 with your eyes 
 she had the pleasure to know 
 and all the things she does 
 she does for me, yeah 
 and she promises the earth to me and i see it needs sweeping 
 what? what? you 
 
 i been waiting a long long time ago 
 please 
 don't run and hide you all the time 
 
 crying, do do do do, it seems
