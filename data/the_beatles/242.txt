 everything's all your life 
 you were only waiting for this moment to arise. 
 i told you so, all i want to be not 
 oh, she does for me, oooh 
 
 every night i've tried before with you 
 the world was waiting for a girl 
 the will stop and did you think to you 
 
 since you left me, i'm so alone 
 now you're coming, you're coming home 
 
 that good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine 
 good morning, good morning, good morning, good morning 
 good morning ah 
 
 you ask me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere 
 so let me know honey how you feel 
 tell me love is real 
 come off your battlefield 
 
 lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void 
 it call me on and on across the universe 
 pools of sorrow, waves of joy 
 
 jai guru deva om 
 
 nothing's gonna change my world 
 nothing's gonna change my world 
 nothing's gonna change
