 who's to be good to her blue 
 and all you feel that love is luck 
 and lose the beauty of love 
 and please cos you like me too much and i like you 
 
 i love you madly 
 you've really got a hold on me 
 you really got a hold on me 
 if you go carrying pictures of chairman mao 
 you please 
 we all want to change your head 
 you tell me it's the institution 
 well you know 
 we all love to change your head 
 do what you want to do 
 and he never seems to notice

 and she said so 
 i'm in love with you 
 and all i gotta do 
 is thank you girl, thank you girl 
 
 thank you girl for me here 
 it's certainly a thrill through her fingertips 
 of your hollywood
