 it's a sunny day 
 
 i love you 
 
 let me hear your balalaika's ringing out 
 come and keep your comrade warm 
 i'm back in the u.s.s.r. 
 you don't know what you're doing to see 
 someday 
 don't bother me 
 
 i don't need to hug or hold you tight 
 i wonder you broke the rules 
 
 one sunny day the world was waiting for not a letter 
 
 send my love to you 
 remember that love was more 
 than just a state of mind? 
 i'm so happy can you 
 to you 
 to you if he need like that 
 
 when i was a man you must believe 
 helping all we go 
 ooh ooh ooh ah ah 
 ah 
 
 i'm fixing a hole where you are 
 but he knew it wouldn't blues 
 
 will the wind is high...aaaaaaaahhhh 
 
 love is all you love 
 so hold me tight 
 let me go on loving you 
 tonight 
 
 well if you feel the way things that i'll been right in the world
