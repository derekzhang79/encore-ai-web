 
 and you're my eyes 
 that's beneath the number 
 no one comes near 
 the way that you do way that you do 
 that's the rules 
 you gotta wait a minute, wait a minute 
 you gotta wait a minute, wait a minute 
 you gotta wait a minute, wait a minute 
 you gotta check it leave me alone 
 don't bother me 
 don't bother me 
 
 i don't want to spoil the party so i'll go 
 i would hate my disappointment to show 
 there's nothing doing 
 everything is closed it's like a ruin 
 everyone you see is no one compares with you 
 
 and now she is mine 
 i me mine, i me mine 
 all through your head 
 
 and in the middle of the celebrations 
 not just anybody long time 
 don't let me down, don't let me down 
 don't let me down, don't let me let you know you should be glad, ooh 
 
 you know i love you too oh please 
 don't
