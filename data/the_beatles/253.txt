 you're going to lose that girl 
 if you won't see me you let me know 
 
 i've had to admit it's getting better (better) 
 a little better all the time it can't get more worse 
 i have to have them all pulled out

 cool cherry cream, nice apple tart 
 i feel your taste all the time we're apart 
 coconut fudge really blows down fast and go 
 
 and now i'm sure of

 she's got the lonely that you 
 
 don't be afraid

 and donated to the national trust 
 
 love you forever and forever 
 love you with all my heart and i
