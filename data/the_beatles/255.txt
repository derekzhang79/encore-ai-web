 take a sad song and make it better 
 
 for the boys all play the game 
 it's easy cos i know 
 now i know that i just had to look 
 having down i'm really down 
 how can you laugh when you know i'm down 
 how can you laugh when you know i'm down. 
 waaaao! baby baby baby i'm really down 
 baby i'm down i'm really down 
 how can you laugh when you smile? 
 
 child-like 
 no no nay will she deceive 
 
 she's got the devil in her heart 
 oh, no, no, no, not a second time 
 not the second time 
 
 i used to think of no one else 
 but you were just the same 
 you didn't even think you never even try, band 
 many people 
 do you have any particular idol that you've ever copied your singing 
 everyone says there'll come a day 
 when i walk alongside of her 
 but all their lips were tight
