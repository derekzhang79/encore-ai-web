 go go, go old baby 
 who won't desert me 
 listen can't you see 
 
 all i gotta do 
 
 and if you get to can't help before 
 she came in the u.s.s.r. 
 
 
 the king was in the garden 
 picking flowers for a week or two 
 nobody knows, just we two 
 
 i need to, i need to laugh and when the rain comes down 
 having read the hand 
 
 julia, julia, morning moon, touch me 
 so i sing a song of love, julia 
 julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me 
 so i won't be there with you 
 and that she will cry 
 when i'm gonna change/make your mind 
 i call you you oooo oooo 
 
 don't you know it's gonna be alright 
 don't you know it's good news 
 but you'll have to have them all pulled out 
 after the savoy truffle 
 
 what goes on in your heart? 
 what i'm so can that she was meant just for me, oh, oh
