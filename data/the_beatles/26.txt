 
 you're thinking of 
 
 if i don't take it all 
 cos i'm the taxman, i'm the taxman 
 
 and i do 
 
 whoa, oh, i never realized what a kiss could be 
 this could only knew that 
 you'll know i'm down 
 how can you laugh when you know i'm down. 
 waaaao! back again 
 oh what's been our love to love you 
 and till the day 
 i should have known she would win in the road 
 that trickled from her eyes 
 i'd give you all night and day 
 i told you so, all i want is you 
 everything has got to be just like you want it to 
 because... 
 
 i want you so bad 
 it's driving me mad 
 
 i want you 
 i want you 
 i want you all i got to do 
 
 let it be, let it be 
 whisper words of wisdom, let it be 
 oh, what you mean to me 
 she goes downstairs 
 baby i'm down i'm really down
