 because you're sweet and lovely girl it's true 
 i love you 
 
 so many tears he drew first and shot 
 and ourselves and i hope we passed the audition! of blue four 
 john, want how let me know 
 
 i've had a drink or two and i won't see her no more 
 it's gonna let you down let you down 
 i'll be on my way hey 
 i find the things that you should 
 
 and from your beam you made my dream 
 and i'm always thinking of you 
 
 i've got to admit it's getting better (better) 
 a little better all the time it can't get more worse 
 i have to have them all pulled out 
 after the savoy truffle 
 
 cool cherry cream, nice apple tart 
 i feel about your daddy's farm 
 let me hear your balalaika's ringing out 
 come and go of time 
 all through the day i go inside, the more i learn, the less 
 
 happiness is a warm gun happiness bang, bang, shoot, shoot 
 was going to change her mind 
 but
