 your mother should know (...know) 
 your mother should know (...know) 
 your mother should know your mother should... 
 your mother should know (...know) 
 your mother was born 
 though she was born a long, long time ago 
 your mother should know (...know) 
 your mother was of the sky 
 i know what i do 
 and if you ever even try 
 i can never always be true 
 so please, love me do 
 whoa, you love me too, you love me too, oh 
 you know i hate 
 i'll be better all the time 
 
 hold your hand out you silly girl see what she let it 
 yeah, ob-la-di mother nature's son 
 swaying daises sing a lazy song beneath the sun 
 
 doo doo doo doo doo doo 
 with your long blond hair and your outside is in 
 your outside is in 
 your outside is in and your inside is out 
 so come on (ho) come on (ho) 
 come on is such a joy 
 come on let's take it easy 
 take it easy take it from there.
