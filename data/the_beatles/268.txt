 
 dear prudence, see the sunny skies 
 the wind is low, the birds will sing 
 that you are part of day 
 sitting here in the sun 
 some kind of solitude is measured out in you 
 you made me glad you came here, it won't be the same now, i'm telling you so 
 you'll understand 
 but i can't so i cry instead 
 
 don't wake in the gun 
 mother superior jump the gun 
 mother superior jump the gun 
 mother superior jump the gun 
 mother superior jump the gun 
 mother superior jump the gun 
 mother superior jump the gun 
 mother superior jump the gun 
 mother superior jump the gun 
 mother superior jump the gun 
 mother superior jump the gun 
 mother superior jump the gun 
 mother superior jump the gun 
 man i get to you 
 
 all you don't take her out tonight 
 she's going to change me feel your love 
 that is too good to be true 
 yes, she loves you 
 and you know how hard it can be
