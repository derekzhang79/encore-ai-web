 don't you know it's gonna be alright 
 don't you realise you know my name and the number you know you know 
 she said so 
 i'm in love with you 
 and all i gotta do 
 is whisper in your ear 
 say the words i long to hear 
 darling when you're sweet and lovely girl it's true 
 i love you 
 
 let me your ears and i'll sing out of sight 
 but don't let me go 
 
 loving you is the natural thing to do 
 i want you 
 i want you 
 i want you 
 i want you for the rest of my life 
 
 come on, give me fever 
 put your name 
 you know you know my name and the number you know you know my name 
 ba ba ba ba ba ba pum 
 look up the number. 
 you know i love you 
 
 the eagle and way that it's 
 
 scarlet were pulled apart 
 
 oh please 
 remember me martha my love 
 don't forget me martha my dear 
 
 hold your hand out
