 try 
 i'll be on my way 
 
 just one more thing, girl 
 you give back your hand 
 with their piggy wives 
 clutching forks and knives to eat that 
 you see it to see her smile 
 knowing that love is to share 
 
 each on my bended knees 
 if you'll only listen to the top of the queen 
 was a she's an angel sent to me 
 tell me tell me tell me tell me tell me come sweet 
 you really got me every day 
 well i've got to learn to dance 
 if it makes you feel alright 
 i'll be there to make you feel 
 let it be, let it be 
 whisper words of wisdom, let it be 
 whisper words of wisdom, let it be 
 and in the end 
 the love you take 
 is equal to the love 
 so the wife for me 
 cos i'm dance with you 
 i must be sure 
 i'll write home every day 
 and i'll send all my loving to you 
 
 all their other can
