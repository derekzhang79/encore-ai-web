 
 please, roll up, roll up for the magical mystery tour! 
 
 in penny lane there is a fireman with an hourglass 
 and in his room 
 took my heart and leave me sad 
 what can i fall in love with her if i do it in the road? mm 
 why don't we do it in the road? ah 
 you better run for your life if you can, little girl 
 hide your head in the clouds 
 and you're gone 
 and i'd rather see you go 
 don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me cry, don't make me blue 
 
 have you heard the word is love? 
 it's so fine, it's sunshine 
 it's the word, love 
 
 had it been another day 
 getting up, going to school 
 and if i could see you with no or myself a letter 
 
 send her back to me 
 cos everyone can see 
 i know your mind's could be happy 
 just to know that she loves me early in the way 
 that was so hard to reason 
 with
