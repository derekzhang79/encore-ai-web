 but you can't see me, you can't see me 
 
 when your prized possessions start to weigh you down 
 look in my direction, i'll be 'round, i'll be 'round 
 
 help me if you can, i'm feeling so upset 
 although i'm so tired i'll have another cigarette

 not arriving

 come on and twist what they have their moments 
 with lovers and our little hideaway beneath the waves 
 resting our head on the sea bed 
 in an octopus's garden with you 
 in an octopus's garden in the shade 
 
 thank " 
 [brian:] all right, stop the band. oh, that's splendid and now, what you see 
 
 something in the way she woos me

 hello hello 
 hello hello 
 i don't know
