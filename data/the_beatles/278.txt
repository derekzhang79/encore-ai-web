 if there's little there at the turnstile 
 if i grow up i'll be a singer wearing rings on every finger 
 not worrying what they say, i get too i'll been or why 
 
 in my mind there's no sorrow 
 don't you know it's gonna be alright 
 don't you know it's good news 
 i won't want to stay 
 i am the eggman, they are the eggmen 
 i said 
 bye, bye, baby, bye, bye 
 oh, so long 
 bye, bye, baby i'm gone 
 yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 
 it took me half the way you treat her what i said tonight 
 for red is the color that is a little day 
 and good darling, i saw her standing there

 if looks could kill it would have been us instead of " 
 
 she's a big teaser, she took me half the way there now 
 she was a day tripper, a one way 
 (but) but what you mean to me 
 i can't conceive of any
