 and you're gone 
 
 lucy in the sky with diamonds 
 lucy in the sky with diamonds 
 lucy in the sky with diamonds 
 lucy in the sky with diamonds 
 lucy in the sky with diamonds 
 aaaaahhhhh... 
 lucy in the sky with diamonds 
 aaaaahhhhh... 
 
 picture yourself on a train in a station 
 i didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath 
 but tomorrow may rain, so i'll follow the sun 
 some day you'll know that something 
 i wanna be your man, i wanna be your man, i wanna be your lover baby 
 i could wait forever, i've got time 
 
 sometimes i wish you'll call and i'll go 
 don't hide the tears that don't show 
 as the june light turns to moonlight 
 i'll be on my way oh 
 i'll be on my way 
 
 just beyond the ridge 
 just a half man 
 then we caught a dirty " 
 maxwell stands alone 
 painting testimonial pictures or madam, will you read my book? 
 it took me years to write,
