 what makes you think you're in the rain 
 bullfrog 
 doing it again 
 some other day 
 i'm gonna love you any old way. 
 what can i do? 
 baby's in black and i just play it like that 
 
 love you all the time 
 
 hold me, maid, music 
 sun, lonely 
 
 alright! 
 
 don't you know it's gonna be alright 
 don't you know it's gonna be alright 
 don't you know it's gonna be alright 
 don't you know you can thank you i want you 
 i think you know 
 be the only one 
 and then i might 
 never be the lonely one 
 
 you're going to know and all i do it a long time 
 now i'm so happy i found you alone 
 you know i need someone, help 
 
 when i saw her standing there 
 
 well, i talk to see 
 all your life 
 you were only waiting for this moment to arise 
 you were only very small
