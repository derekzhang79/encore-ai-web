 full speed it is, sgt.! 
 cut the cable, drop the cable! 
 aye, sir, aye! 
 captain, captain! [pronounced cap'n, cap'n]} 
 
 as the june light turns to moonlight 
 the worm at his world 
 not the second time 
 
 went out last night, i didn't have a girl, aware 
 but you will be the same 
 if the rain comes they run and hide 
 you make me dizzy, miss lizzy 
 the way you treat her what else can i do? 
 
 i call your name 
 i call your name 
 i call your name 
 but with a call from me 
 i never weep at night 
 i call your name 
 i call your name 
 i call your name 
 i call your name 
 young blood, ah young blood, young blood, oh young blood, yeah young blood 
 i can't go on 
 holding back these tears in my door 
 will i ever have lost you 
 when i loved you 
 
 but if the bigger piggies 
 in their starched white shirts? 
 you
