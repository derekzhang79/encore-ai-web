 
 how? 
 dogs for dogging, hands for clapping 
 birds for birding and fish for everyone 
 
 we're sgt. pepper's lonely hearts club band 
 we hope you have enjoyed the show 
 it's wonderful to be here 
 it's certainly a thrill on me 
 shine on until tomorrow, let it be 
 whisper words of wisdom, let it be 
 
 let it be, let it be 
 let it be, let it be 
 whisper words of wisdom, let it be 
 listen and i can say 
 i'm in love with you 
 
 love, love me do 
 whoa, love me do 
 you know i believe and how 
 
 you're asking me will my love grow 
 no no nay will she deceive 
 
 i think about you all the time 
 
 hold your head up you silly girl look she will never be free 
 when i was around you 
 silly girl

 love you whisper soft and true 
 darling i love you 
 
 all together now all together now all together now all together now
