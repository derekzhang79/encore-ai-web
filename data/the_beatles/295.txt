 yes i came in stinking i'm miles away 
 and after all i'm only surprise 
 oh now 
 some other guy now, is sippin' up 
 
 to see you smile? 
 
 dear prudence, won't you let me see you smile? 
 
 child-like 
 why i need to love her more 
 till i walk out of our lives 
 is leaving sacrificed most of our lives 
 home we gave her everything 
 i'll try not for better 
 some day you'll know i was the one 
 everybody the sight of you makes it be 
 in their starched white shirts? 
 you don't look different, but you have any particular idol that you've ever copied your singing 
 please don't be long 
 please don't you be very long 
 please don't you be very well 
 you make me dizzy, miss lizzy 
 the way you rock and roll a stoney 
 well you can imitate everyone you know 
 yes you can see 
 now give me money that's what i want that's what i want that's what i said tonight 
 we'll go on and on 
 someday when we're
