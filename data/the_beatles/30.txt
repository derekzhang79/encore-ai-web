 wishing to be free 
 
 blackbird fly 
 blackbird fly 
 into the light of the dark black night. 
 
 when your prized possessions start to weigh you down 
 give me one more chance 
 try to save our romance! 
 
 slow down, baby, now you're movin' way too fast 
 you gotta gimme little lovin', gimme little lovin' 
 ow! if you please me, whoa yeah, like i please you 
 
 cos i won't be there with you 
 you are so sweet and so near 
 i'm sure to fall in love with her 
 in memphis, tennessee 
 
 the picker! the picker! picture the fingers burning! 
 
 oo-wee! 
 
 he's a real nowhere time 
 not a dead of night 
 take these broken wings and learn to fly 
 all your life 
 you were above me, but not today 
 
 yes i can do 
 just call on us and i'll be back again tonight 
 telling me all the time, you know 
 she said so 
 i'm in love with you 
 and all i gotta do 
 is thank you girl,
