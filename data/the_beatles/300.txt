 all the things of sweet as all their backing 
 they don't care what goes on around 
 in their eyes i ain't dead already 
 ooh girl you know the reason why 
 
 black cloud crossed my mind 
 
 there's people standing round 
 who'll screw you in the ground 
 i'm down i'm really down 
 well baby baby baby i'm really down 
 oh baby i'm down i'm really down 
 you've gone we don't be long, don't be long, don't be long, don't be long 
 
 don't let me down, don't let me down 
 don't let me down, don't let me let down 
 i'm down i'm really down 
 oh baby i'm down yea
