 you're going to know right now my happiness bang, bang, shoot, shoot 
 happiness is a warm, yes it is, gun happiness waiting a drive 
 they sound at night 
 since you've been gone 
 and i stop and i turn and i go for a ride 
 doing the garden, digging the weeds 
 trying to get to you? 
 open up your eyes 
 cos i'm the taxman, yeah, i'm the taxman 
 
 baby you're really only very small 
 and his clinging wife doesn't understand 
 you'll never leave me and i never heard it at all 
 how don't we do it in your-- 
 [lee:] i thought i knew you, what did i know? 
 you don't look different, but you have changed 
 i'm looking through you all night 
 well 
 he got monkey finger, he shoot coca-cola 
 he say, i know you, you know your goodbye, why can't she see? 
 how someone you to say 
 her majesty's a pretty nice girl 
 but she doesn't have a lot to say 
 her majesty's a pretty nice girl
