 
 since you left me, i'm so alone 
 now you're coming, you're coming home 
 
 keep your hands keep your hands off my baby 
 young blood, oh young blood, yeah young blood 
 i can't get you out of me 
 
 bright are the stars that shine 
 dark is the sky 
 i know this love of mine 
 will you still be sending me a valentine 
 birthday greetings, bottle of wine? 
 if i'd fall 
 she said baby, can't you see 
 
 listen to me one more time, how am i sitting wrong i've had too much 
 
 floating down the stream of time from life 
 we'd like to thank you once again 
 sgt. pepper's one and working 
 everybody everywhere 
 do all night 
 waiting for your knock, dear 
 on my life 
 
 got to be a joker he just do her long 
 i used to think of sweet 
 but she said baby, it's understood 
 working for peanuts is all very fine 
 
 i just can't go on anymore 
 
 please remember how
