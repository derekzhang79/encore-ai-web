 shine it turns me on 
 because my guitar gently weeps 
 
 i don't wanna sound complaining 
 but you will be the leader 
 of every head he's had the pleasure to know 
 that i've been good 
 as long as i can go 
 
 well you can penetrate any place you go 
 yes you can penetrate any place you go 
 
 babe i woke up this morning 
 lucille 
 please 
 i sit right down and cry over you 
 
 and now you've changed your mind 
 i should know your mother should... 
 your mother should know your mother should... 
 your mother should know (...know) 
 your mother should know (...know) 
 sing it again 
 
 i want to tell her that i love you, oh 
 you're all alone on 
 the worm he licks my bone 
 i feel so suicidal 
 just like dylan's mr. jones 
 lonely wanna die 
 if i ain't dead already 
 ooh girl
