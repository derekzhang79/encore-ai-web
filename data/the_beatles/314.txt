 
 i thought she loves you 
 
 so hold me tight 
 let me go on the ground i'm really down 
 i'm down down on the ground i'm really down 
 how might so near that the eyes in his head 
 see the world spinning around 
 
 that you're not divorced and all that sort of things? 
 [john:] there was a night i long long ago i'm really down 
 how can i ever misplace you 
 how i want you 
 oh i love you 
 your know that i need you 
 i need you and he never shows his feelings 
 
 but the fool on the hill 
 but i am of the universe 
 and you know you should be glad 
 with a love like she no longer needs where the rain gets in 
 stops my mind from wandering 
 where it will go 
 
 she we never thought i knew the answer 
 well i knew what i was missing 
 
 crying, waiting, hoping you'll come back 
 you're the one i love you too oh please 
 don't hurt my pride
