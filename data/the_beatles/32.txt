 
 lift up your hearts and like a man 
 she's not the same 
 i never weep at night 
 i see no use in wondering why 
 i cry for you 
 
 i've been away now 
 don't bother me 
 
 i don't want to spoil the party so i'll go 
 don't you run and hide 
 just stay away 
 i'll try to make it away 
 give me your answer, fill in a form 
 on our way back home 
 we're on our way home 
 we're going home 
 
 [we're going home, you better believe it. goodbye.] to go 
 sgt. pepper's lonely, sgt. pepper's lonely 
 sgt. pepper's lonely hearts club band 
 we hope you have enjoyed the show 
 sgt. pepper's lonely hearts club band 
 it's getting very near the end wrong 
 we'll go on and on 
 someday when we're dreaming 
 deep in love, not a lot to say 
 her majesty's a pretty nice girl 
 but she loves me so tenderly 
 said i got a woman way cross town 
 she's good to me, oh yeah
