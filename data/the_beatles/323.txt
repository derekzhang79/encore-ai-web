 
 well with the many things i've got to been here 
 please don't come near 
 someday when i get home tonight 
 be the way i do? 
 it's only love, and that is all 
 but it's so fine, it's sunshine 
 who disagree and get him 
 i am the walrus, goo goo g' joob 
 
 mister city policeman sitting, pretty little policemen in a by brown 
 it's a man who misses much 
 
 this boy 
 this boy [fade out] 
 the words of kindness linger on 
 come on come on 
 come on, come on, come on, come on... 
 
 come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on 
 
 little child, little child 
 little child, won't you dance with me? 
 i'm so sad and lonely 
 baby take a chance with me 
 baby take a chance with me 
 baby take a chance with me 
 baby take a chance with me 
 baby take a chance with me 
 baby take a chance with me 
 baby take a chance with me
