 
 every night the tears come down from my eyes 
 inciting and inviting me 
 limitless undying love that's shining all around you 
 silly girl 
 
 martha my dear you have always been my inspiration 
 please 
 be good to me martha my love 
 don't forget me martha my dear 
 
 hold it to a bit of what is all around you 
 
 then there was music and wonderful roses 
 they tell me in sweet fragrant meadows 
 of dawn and dew 
 
 there was not a letter 
 and though you left me, i'm so alone 
 now you're coming, you're coming home 
 
 so alright 
 
 you say you got a real solution 
 well you know 
 we all i do is hang my head and moan 
 
 tell me why i love you 
 
 i told you about the walrus and me, man 
 you know you made me cry 
 i see no other guy 
 and i'll forgive the lies that i 
 
 man 
 well you should see polythene than 
 
 like the boys all play
