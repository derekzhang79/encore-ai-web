 that is confusing things 
 from my girlfriend in mind 
 and you're my baby, clarabella 
 you're my honey, clarabella 
 woo ooh, you know 
 
 i've just seen a face 
 i can't forget the meaning of within 
 it makes me your ears and in their eyes 
 a four of fish and your man 
 and all you not 
 the world was waiting for a lover 
 some gonna make a big star way for day 
 i can work it again 
 
 i don't know why it's gonna be alright 
 
 you say you'll love me too 
 you'll love me too, you don't need me 
 ain't got nothing but love, girl 
 eight days such a kind girl 
 seems so hard to find gideon's bible 
 gideon checked out ahead 
 
 two of us sending postcards 
 writing letters 
 on my wall 
 and maybe you will get a call from me 
 if i needed someone 
 if she turns her back on the boy 
 he creeps up in sweet fragrant meadows 
 of dawn and dew
