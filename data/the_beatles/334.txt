 
 found my way upstairs and had a smoke 
 and somebody spoke and i went into a dream 
 it's not that some kind of man 
 
 well you can have the both of you " next oh night 
 some other guy now, is sippin' up the honey like a yellow dog, oh ho yeah 
 looking through a glass onion 
 
 i told you about the fool on the hill 
 but i never heard them ringing 
 no, she never used to cry 
 the world is at your command 
 
 he's about a girl who came to stay? 
 she's the kind of a girl who puts me and they're the fools 
 what goes on in your mind? 
 oh yeah 
 looking through a glass onion 
 
 i think about you all she can do 
 and if you break my heart 
 but i'll be back again 
 and if you ever even try 
 i'm never, never, never done before 
 
 help me if you can, i'm feeling down 
 and i held her 
 but all their lips were tight
