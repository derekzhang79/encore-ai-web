 
 oh ho! 
 
 ah lucille 
 woo boy may been away 
 someday when we're dreaming 
 deep in love, not a lot to say 
 her majesty's a pretty nice girl 
 but she doesn't have a lot to say 
 that you would love me more than her 
 
 though tonight she's made me glad 
 when you were there? 
 nothing that can i do? 
 
 i sit right down and cry over you 
 i'm gonna love you more and more every day 
 and if you ever even try 
 i wouldn't let you leave me cos it's true 
 cos you like me too much and i like you 
 
 keep your hands keep your hands keep your hands keep your hands keep your hands keep your hands keep your hands off my baby out baby 
 the jokey folks they had to do hark the angels come".] 
 life comes the fall 
 and i'm only very start 
 that you would lose my hair 
 i'm an ole poor boy, and i'm a 
 long way 
 now the been another guy
