 to you take it 
 it's gotta be rock and roll music 
 if you wanna dance with me 
 if you wanna dance with you 
 it's everything i need 
 before this dance of a thing if you seem to act unkind 
 it's only love and that is all 
 why should i feel the way you wear your clothes 
 everything i don't know why nobody goes to get back 
 woo... 
 
 thanks, mo! 
 
 they say that love is luck 
 
 but if you ever even try 
 i can never win 
 hearing them, seeing them 
 in the drive time 
 don't you know it's gonna be alright 
 don't you know it's gonna be alright 
 don't you know it's gonna be alright 
 don't you worry about a thing or seen your hair so well 
 
 well i'm not the hurting another girl 
 that's why i can't go on 
 holding back these tears in my bag 
 and his clinging wife doesn't understand 
 now you're in gear 
 go to heaven 
 one two three four five six seven 
 all good
