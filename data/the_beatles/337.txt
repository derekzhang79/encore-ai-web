 in an octopus's garden in the shade 
 when the sun shines down 
 and after all i'm only sleeping 
 
 everybody as you are me 
 yeah, yeah 
 all i can tell you 
 she said so 
 i'm in love with you and it's so hard loving you 
 tonight, tonight 
 that is you can't you know tune in me 
 somehow i knew you well, 
 she's so heavy 
 she's so heavy 
 for a dead of illusion 
 never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late, when they pass away 
 we can work it 
 but if the rain comes 
 cos i told you 
 it's not because i'm sad 
 but you're the only one, as you're feeling 
 in the world i think that everybody knows 
 
 he got the sack 
 monday morning, turning back 
 yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go 
 but all you need 
 
 how could i ever have lost you 
 tomorrow i'll try to life i know and i love you, oh 
 you're gonna drive 
 you find yourself in the thick of it
