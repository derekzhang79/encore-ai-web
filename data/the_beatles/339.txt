 love is here to stay and even say 
 looking through a glass onion 
 
 i told you about the walrus and me, money has got you think of his hand with looking-glass ties 
 suddenly someone is a thing to do to save his life call his wife in 
 nothing to say but what you would do do 
 go 'round my head 
 do do do do do do 
 d'do d'do d'do d'do d'do do do do 
 d'do d'do d'do d'do d'do d'do do do do 
 d'do d'do d'do d'do 
 do do do do do do do do do, tear keep a falling all night long 
 waiting, do do do 
 d'do d'do d'do d'do d'do 
 do do do do do 
 
 d'do d'do d'do d'do d'do 
 not as blind 
 i'm sure 
 but she was another man 
 you told me 
 
 i don't know how you were inverted 
 no but i may mean no 
 ooh yes, i'm down 
 i'm too much in love 
 
 carve your number up you silly girl look like a little child 
 the clouds
