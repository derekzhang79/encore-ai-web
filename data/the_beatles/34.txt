 baby's in black and i'm feeling blue 
 tell me, oh what can i do? 
 
 had a minute mister postman 
 wait, wait mister postman 
 so patiently 
 for a seance in the dark black night. 
 
 blackbird singing in the dead of night 
 take these broken wings and learn to fly 
 all your life 
 
 baby you can drive my car 
 yes i'm gonna be a star 
 baby you can drive my car 
 yes i'm gonna be a star 
 baby you should 
 
 that taste of honey 
 tasting much sweeter than wine 
 
 it is no surprise now, now 
 with a rocking in two by two - ooo 
 
 cry
