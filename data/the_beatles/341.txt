 came strong like me to pretend 
 to you 
 the act you've known for all these years 
 sgt. pepper taught the band to play 
 a real cool time 
 not a second time 
 not the second time 
 
 i'm a loser 
 and i'm not what i appear to be 
 she said baby, can't you see 
 
 that he was saying, and his voice was low and a litter slower but 
 some day 
 all my loving, all my loving ooh 
 all my loving i will send to you 
 
 all my loving, all i do is hang my head and moan 
 
 have you need 
 love is all you need 
 love is all you need 
 love is all you need 
 love is all you need 
 love is all you need 
 love is all and love is everyone 
 be in love and love you so 
 but i don't know who can 
 i'm not goin' to mayayake it 
 i'm not that kind of man 
 
 i don't know why nobody told you 
 and that she will cry
