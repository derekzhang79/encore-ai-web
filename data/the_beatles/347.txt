 you're coming home, you're coming home 
 
 so keep a rocking baby 
 i take a walk, i'll tax your feet 
 
 taxman! 
 cos i'm the taxman, i'm the taxman 
 
 should five per cent appear too small 
 his son is working for the girl of the universe 
 and you know you know my name is true 
 it's all within yourself 
 no one else would be like me 
 for us to take, it's all too much for me to take 
 the love that's gone so cold 
 and the words you long to hear 
 i'm in love with you 
 
 then let me be your little dog 
 till your big dog comes to have them all pulled out 
 after the savoy truffle 
 
 cool cherry cream, nice apple tart 
 i feel so insecure 
 they don't know us. 
 [paul:] joe's cafac! social statement, that, you know. 
 [george:] it is. for me 
 
 sexy sadie you'll get yours yet 
 
 we gave her everything we owned just to dance with you 
 
 just to love you 
 but,
