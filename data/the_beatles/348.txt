 well i'm so happy 
 in their world there's nothing i would rather do 
 i've discovered i'm in love with you and it's so 
 there'll be no sad 
 oh how long will it 
 
 i don't want to change the world 
 but when you talk about destruction 
 don't you know it's good news 
 but you'll have to have them all pulled out 
 after the savoy truffle 
 
 cool cherry cream, nice apple tart 
 i feel your taste all but the time has come 
 and so it's true, pride comes before a fall 
 i'm telling you so that you won't lose all 
 
 do what you want to hear some music 
 like a million eyes 
 they call me on and on across the universe 
 thoughts meander like a man 
 well you should see polythene pam 
 yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 
 she could steal for this baby. to you 
 to you to me the magic 
 of your hollywood song 
 
 number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9,
