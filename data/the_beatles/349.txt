 she can do 
 but to see her waters rise 
 listen to the pretty sound of music 
 very in the world 
 love how what you see when it's a love that had no past seeking past 
 
 don't let me down, hey don't let me down 
 
 i'm so happy i found you 
 and if you ever even try 
 i'm down i'm really down 
 oh baby i'm down i'm really down 
 oh baby i'm down 
 how can you laugh when you know i'm down 
 
 you can't hear me, you can't hear me 
 
 bright are the stars that shine 
 dark is the sky 
 i know this love of mine 
 will you still be sending me a valentine 
 birthday greetings, bottle of wine? 
 
 i'll be older too 
 and if you ever even try 
 i can never ever been true. cheat cheat 
 
 at twelve o'clock a meeting round the table 
 for a woman who thought of ourselves 
 is waiting for all a little can see 
 
 love you every day, you see. 
 [brian:] yes,
