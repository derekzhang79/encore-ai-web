 made sure that what was i ever been true. cheat cheat 
 
 i'm wondering i can do 
 just to know where you've been 
 i saw you peep through your window 
 
 i'm a loser 
 and i lost someone who's near to you 
 
 since you left me, i'm so alone 
 now you're coming, you're coming home 
 
 every night now, what you see 
 
 listen to the music playing in your head 
 
 tuesday afternoon is never ending 
 wednesday morning papers didn't come 
 thursday night your stocking needed mending 
 see how they run 
 i'm crying, i'm crying 
 
 i'm ringo and i 
 
 why can't you be true? 
 i said we're trav'ling on the one after 909 
 
 i told that girl i can do 
 just call on us and we'll send it along 
 with love from us to you

 please don't you be very long 
 please don't be long 
 please don't you be very long
