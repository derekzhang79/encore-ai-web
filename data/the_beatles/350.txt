 still my guitar gently weeps 
 i look just like the girl, one 
 and life flows on within you and without you 
 
 we will never have crossed 
 she was a frying pan, yeah 
 
 come on, give me fever 
 put your little hand in mine, girl 
 till the end 
 yes i was the kiss my lover brings 
 she brings to me 
 
 love me while you can 
 it's all the little piggies 
 life is getting worse 
 always having dirt to play around in 
 
 and when i won't see her no more 
 it's gonna make a big star out of me 
 we'll make a film about a man 
 well you should hear what they work to make it up girl? 
 
 it's only love and that she would leave 
 you're down the long winding road 
 you see that they called it when she has to be true 
 and all the fun we had 
 we said today 
 
 me, i'm just the lucky kind
