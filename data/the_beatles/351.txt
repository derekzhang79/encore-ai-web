 when a boy was paul 
 and we are all the little piggies 
 life is getting dark 
 everyone you see is in 
 and stops my mind from wandering 
 where it will go oh 
 
 good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine 
 good day sunshine, good day sunshine 
 good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine 
 good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine 
 good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine 
 good morning, good morning, good 
 good morning, good morning 
 good morning, good morning, good 
 good morning, good morning, good morning, good morning, good 
 good morning, good morning, good morning, good morning, good 
 good morning, good morning, good morning, good 
 good morning, good morning, good morning 
 good morning, good morning, good 
 good morning, good morning, good morning, good morning, good 
 good morning, good morning 
 good morning ah 
 
 all my loving i will send to you 
 all my loving, darling i'll be true
