 doesn't have a point of view 
 indicate precisely what you mean to me 
 oh, she do me, yes, she does 
 and if you ever even try 
 i'm gonna sit right down and cry over you 
 i'm gonna sit right down and hold it

 well, with your head in the clouds may mine 
 getting so much better all the time 
 all through the day i call you on the phone 
 and you'll come running home 
 all the children sing
