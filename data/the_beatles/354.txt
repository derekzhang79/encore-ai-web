 
 nowhere man, don't worry 
 no no nay will she deceive 
 
 she's got the devil in her heart 
 no she's an angel sent to me 
 
 i'm filling myself and you'll be free 
 say the words you long to hear 
 i'm in love with you and it's a love like that 
 you know my name 
 you know you know my name and the number you know you know 
 
 though tonight she's made me sad 
 i still go and a-playing 
 in the mood for whirling 
 
 um 
 [john:] can you do mickey mouse? 
 [lee:] yes. 
 [ringo:] all ring, sing a song, fellows. 
 [john:] okay, let's go! 
 go on, man! come 
 thursday night your stocking needed mending 
 see her no more 
 it's gonna be a drag... misery! 
 
 i'll make love to you and i believe for you 
 
 come and keep your comrade warm or madam, will never die 
 and if you say the word 
 i could stay with you 
 
 from if you told me
