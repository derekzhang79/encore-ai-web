 the long i will say but what i done to deserve such a fate 
 i realize your mind's made up 
 you're gonna cause more misery 
 
 i'm the only goes up this one 
 but happy ever after in the market place 
 molly lets the children lend a hand arm! leg! 
 molly stays at home and does his pretty face to say 
 that the more time is guaranteed for all 
 and till she's here 
 please don't let me down 
 don't let me down, don't let me let down 
 when i'm in the middle of a dream 
 stay in bed, float up stream float up stream 
 
 please remember how i feel about you 
 i get shy when they start to stare 
 i'm gonna hide myself away, ay hay 
 but a day like today lay before get your hands off my baby 
 ain't i gonna tell you but one more time 
 who, is i know love will never die
