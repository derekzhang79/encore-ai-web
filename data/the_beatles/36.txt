 a thing or two 
 to say about you all the time 
 all my loving, all my loving ooh 
 all my loving i will send to you 
 i don't care fade out 
 
 don't let me down, hey don't let me down 
 
 don't let me down, don't let me down 
 don't let me down, don't let me let you know 
 but we will remember 
 things we said today 
 
 me, i'm just the lucky kind 
 love to hear you say that i've been unhappy with you 
 
 come on, give me fever 
 take me your ears and i'll close mine 
 good night, sleep tight 
 now the moon begins to shine 
 good night, sleep tight 
 now the moon begins to shine 
 good night, sleep tight 
 now the moon begins to shine 
 good children go to heaven 
 one two three four five six seven 
 all good children go to heaven 
 one two three four five six seven 
 all good children go to heaven
