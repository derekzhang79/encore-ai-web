 look around 
 
 dear prudence, won't you come out to play? 
 
 you're the one i love, i finally heard 
 i'll be writing more in a week or two 
 and i held her hand in mine... 
 
 whoah, we danced through the night 
 and when your big dog gets here 
 watch how your puppy dog runs 
 
 i said i'm still yawning 
 
 don't let me down 
 don't let me down, don't let me let down 
 
 me with a man 
 the less one really knows 
 
 arrive without never touch of you all 
 but it's so hard loving you 
 
 come and go to school 
 when i'm in the middle of a dream 
 stay in bed, float up stream float up stream 
 wow and work it on out, honey work it on out work it on out 
 
 she's a big teaser, she took me half the way there 
 but i can 
 and if i ran away from you 
 and me no diamond ring and i'll be there and was i look at you all see
