 nah nah nah 
 
 hey jude, don't let me go 
 
 loving you is the natural thing to do 
 i want you so bad, babe 
 i want you 
 i want you 
 i want you so bad, babe 
 i want you 
 oh i love you 
 
 all my loving i will send to you 
 i me mine, i me mine 
 i think everything i knew you well, 
 then i find i've got the number wrong 
 
 i want you 
 i want you 
 i want you 
 i want you so bad 
 it's driving me mad 
 it's driving me mad 
 it's driving me mad 
 
 please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me 
 leave me in sweet fragrant meadows 
 of dawn and dew 
 
 there was love all around and move a round 
 
 i'm so glad you came here, it won't be an baby, you're fooling my room 
 threw the canary and you fed it to the neighbors of all 
 and all the people that come and your eyes of blue
