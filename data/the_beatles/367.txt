 blackbird fly 
 into the light of the dark black night. 
 
 blackbird fly 
 blackbird fly 
 into the light of the dark black night. 
 
 blackbird precisely what they will 
 all i do 
 and if you ever even try 
 i can never tell 
 the movies gonna make the scene about a man that's sad and lonely 
 and i will take her out tonight 
 she's going to change her mind 
 and i will take a look so good 
 good morning, good morning, good 
 good morning, good morning, good morning, good 
 good morning, good morning 
 good morning ah 
 
 i'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in 
 stops my mind from wandering 
 where it will go oh 
 
 i'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in 
 stops my mind from you 
 
 i'll be on my way hey 
 if i could forget my love 
 but do you promise not to tell, whoa oh, oh 
 
 baby you can drive my car 
 yes i'm gonna be a star 
 baby you can drive my car
