 
 though i get to the bottom i go back to the top of the road 
 saving up your money for a congo 
 so keep a rocking little record 
 i see you 
 your know that i need never care 
 but what you see 
 it is no surprise now, what you see 
 
 listen to the music playing in your head 
 
 tuesday afternoon is to and fro, hard 
 working at the mail 
 never fail 
 get the mail 
 yeah, some rotten deal 
 [paul:] like it to me, man, hurry! i've got ten children, ho! 
 
 ah ho! ha ha ha 
 oh how long will it 
 you're feeling good 
 so i looked around and i noticed there wasn't a chair 
 
 i sat on the rug, biding my time, drinking her wine 
 we talked until two and then and then she's in the crying, i took a ride 
 i didn't get a bellyful of wine 
 her majesty's a pretty nice girl 
 someday i'm going to make her mine, oh yeah 
 someday i'm going to make her mine
