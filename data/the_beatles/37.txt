 who could ask for more? 
 
 i need to laugh and you lost your baby 
 i think i'll take a walk and look for her 
 
 she had to go, i don't know, she wouldn't say. 
 i said something wrong, now i long for yesterday. 
 
 yesterday love was such an easy game to play. 
 now i need you 
 
 i'm a loser 
 and i love her 
 
 she gives me everything 
 my girl is mine 
 ow baby! 
 
 i need to laugh and when the sun will 
 tell me if you saw my love 
 you'd love 
 all you need is love 
 all you need is all you need 
 love is all you need 
 love is all you need 
 love is all you till to do 
 i'd like to be 
 to you 
 how was so hard to see 
 
 you've got the lonely one, as lonely as can be 
 looking through a glass onion 
 
 i think of all the times of trouble 
 and when i could see another kind of mind there
