 but i got a whole lot of things to tell her 
 when i get home

 monday morning, turning back 
 on the mantel shelf 
 see the hands you see. 
 [brian:] you don't get time to hang a sign on me 
 in an octopus's garden in the shade

 words of love you whisper soft and true

 so please, love me do 
 whoa, oh, these chains of love got a hold on me, yeah
