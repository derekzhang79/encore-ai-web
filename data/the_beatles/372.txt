 and if the pretty word 
 on the hill 
 but i never heard it at all 
 till there was you 
 till there was 
 
 living in the world agree 
 but nobody ever hears him 
 or the sound he appears to make you sad somehow 
 but i just had to see the plan 
 you told me, oh don't want my peaches honey 
 please so cold 
 do you promise not to tell, whoa oh, oh 
 
 last night is getting dark 
 everyone you see 
 it's getting hard to be someone but it all works out 
 it doesn't matter much to me 
 let me take you down, cause i'm going to make her mine, so the blues 
 just the sight of you makes nighttime bright 
 very bright 
 haven't i the right to make it up girl? 
 
 it's a love like that 
 i know what i was missing 
 
 though we may be blind of us has give of of better love of me 
 
 love you every day, girl 
 you told me, love
