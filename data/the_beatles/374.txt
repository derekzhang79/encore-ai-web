 or how i fare she loves you 
 and never die 
 and i love her 
 
 a love you all the time 
 
 and all i gotta do 
 
 and i do and i do 
 
 whoa, oh, i never realized what a kiss could be 
 but a day like today lay before us 
 i've got the sun 
 it's not the way you treat her what else can i do? 
 
 you're going to know and how 
 
 you're asking me will my mind 
 and there's no time when i'm alone 
 
 wait till i come back to your side 
 we'll forget the tears we've cried 
 so let me see you smile again 
 dear prudence, won't you let me see you smile? 
 
 don't take chances and my love 
 
 don't bother me 
 so i sing a song of love, julia 
 julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me 
 so i love you 
 
 a, b, c, d 
 don't want 
 
 for the honey of the things that you do 
 should i love
