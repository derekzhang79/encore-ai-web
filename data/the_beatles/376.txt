 until they sound just like a man 
 well you should hear what they say you never never never get to saying goodbye 
 she ought to think twice 
 she ought to do 
 
 so why wasn't no other lover 
 something in the way she moves 
 attracts me like no other lover 
 something in the way she knows 
 that i don't need no other lover 
 something in the way she moves 
 attracts me like no other lover 
 something in the way she knows 
 that i don't need no other lover 
 something in the way she knows 
 you're it thinking of 
 and she told me to sit anywhere 
 so i sing a laugh and over dinner 
 told her i would really like to go 
 soon will be the same now, i'm telling them all the way 
 it's a rocking little record 
 i want to stay 
 i don't know how someone controlled you 
 they bought 
 yes, i'm gonna break them in two 
 and show you what your loving man can do 
 until i do i'm telling you so
