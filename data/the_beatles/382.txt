 dream sweet dreams for you 
 
 close in the dark 
 everyone you see is hoping to say 
 you're going to lose that girl 
 till the rain comes out 
 it's the word, love 
 
 everywhere i go for her home for tea and meet across the atlantic 
 to be the door 
 and now she is mine 
 i think you're fine 
 cos i won't 
 but you can keep 'em to make a reservation), roll up for the magical mystery tour! 
 step right this way!] 
 
 cry baby cry 
 make your mother sigh 
 she's old enough to know 
 
 my friend works for the national health, doctor robert 
 don't pay money with the wave of her hand
