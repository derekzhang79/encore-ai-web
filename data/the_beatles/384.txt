 the games begin 
 to make his early start, i'm making sure that i'm not the many ways i've tried 
 and still they lead me back, to the long winding road 
 you left me standing here, a long long time ago 
 your mother should know (...know) 
 your mother should know (...know) 
 your mother was born 
 though she was born a long, long time ago 
 your mother should know your mother should... 
 your mother should know (...know) 
 your mother should know your mother should... 
 your mother should know your mother should... 
 your mother should know (...know) 
 
 lift up your ring to me, 
 
 i'm so glad that she's my little girl 
 she's so heavy 
 she's so heavy 
 she's so heavy 
 she's so heavy 
 she's so heavy 
 she's so heavy 
 she's so heavy 
 she's so heavy 
 she's so heavy 
 for just a card or just a letter 
 saying she's returning home to you 
 we'd all love to see the plan 
 you may be awoken, i'll be 'round, i'll be 'round
