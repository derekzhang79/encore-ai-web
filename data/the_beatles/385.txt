 
 i can't go on 
 if you won't see me you won't see me 
 you won't see me you won't see me 
 
 girl you said 
 like i love only " 
 
 though he'll regret it someday 
 but i can't turn away 
 
 out of college, money spent 
 see no future, pay no rent 
 all the money's gone, nowhere to go 
 don't buy her right, i see it needs sweeping 
 still my guitar gently weeps 
 
 i'd love to turn you on 
 but it's so hard loving you 
 yes it's true 
 what all i do 
 and i do know 
 
 well i say high, you say goodbye 
 and i say it's all right 
 standing in the market tree 
 i say i'm no one but a day 
 
 don't you know it's gonna be alright 
 don't you know it's gonna be alright 
 don't you know it's good news 
 but you'll have to have them all pulled out 
 after the savoy truffle 
 
 cool cherry cream, nice apple tart 
 i feel good and i
