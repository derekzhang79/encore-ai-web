 i will say i love you 
 beep beep'm beep beep yeah fade out 
 after the savoy truffle 
 
 at twelve o'clock a meeting round the table 
 for a seance in the dark 
 everyone you see is all their backing 
 i won't see your misery 
 waiting for your knock, dear 
 on my old front door 
 i must admit they have a rocking band 
 beep style it can 
 
 and when i do you'd better hide all the girls forever and tell you 
 maybe you'd understand 
 i can't conceive of any more misery 
 
 i'm the 
 way cross being 
 
 we can work it out and get it straight, or say 
 
 but this boy wants you back again 
 
 oh, and this boy would be free 
 man, i could remember all the things we planned 
 understand, it's true 
 yes it is, yes it is 
 yes i do what you want to do 
 and go where you're going to 
 think for yourself 
 cos i won't be there and everywhere 
 here, there and
