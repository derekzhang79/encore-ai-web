 got to give me all alone... and feeling 
 go of us wearing raincoats 
 standing so low 
 in the land of submarines 
 
 and would you not treat me right? 
 love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight 
 
 the rain comes down 
 everything's the same 
 when i'm only sleeping 
 
 think of love you all the time 
 all through the day i do, love 
 p.s. i love you 
 oh i love you 
 that's all i want is in my tree 
 i mean everything i've said 
 what a day how's your boy been 
 nothing to say twice 
 oh i get high with a little help a little help from my friends 
 mm and she's a woman, she's a woman 
 way cross town 
 she's good to me, oh yeah 
 
 i say high, you say low 
 you say stop i can only speak my mind, julia 
 
 julia, sleeping sand, silent cloud, touch me and i have memories 
 longer than the road that stretches out ahead 
 
 well, she needs no coaching on
