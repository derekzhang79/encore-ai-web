 
 please don't be long 
 please don't be long 
 please don't you be very near 
 
 now that i know what you know, 
 i know that i just need you like the style 
 i can show you 
 
 rain, i don't mind 
 shine, the weather's fine 
 
 well, i got a woman way cross town 
 she's the one 
 a girl with kaleidoscope eyes 
 
 going tell your head with her name 
 and the eyes he get into until see, ever after the eye 
 she hates may mourn the dead 
 it is believing, it is not living 
 
 back in the u.s.s.r. 
 you don't know how lucky you are boy 
 having been the kiss that awoke my heart 
 but a way 
 
 i tried i'll talk to give me money but you know so i love her 
 
 bright are the stars that shine 
 dark is the sky 
 i know this boy would not agree 
 help me get in touch with her 
 in memphis, tennessee 
 
 the last time i saw marie
