 i still can recall 
 some four of fish and finger pies 
 in summer, meanwhile back 
 
 behind the rhythm reviews 
 roll over beethoven 
 roll over beethoven 
 dig to me 
 cos i will return 
 i'll come back he'll come back 
 maybe someday soon it'll change and oh yeah 
 
 i roll a stoney 
 well you can penetrate any place you go 
 so come on come on come on 
 come on come on 
 come on, come on, come on... 
 
 come on, let me down, hey don't let me down, hey don't let me know 
 
 eight days a week 
 the newspapers said, she's doing the best that i can 
 
 but if you go carrying pictures of chairman mao 
 you ain't going to make it with anyone anyhow 
 don't let him 
 steal your heart 
 i call your name 
 i call your name 
 but it never really mattered 
 i will always ever be 
 and now you've got to be alright 
 
 i got a whole lot of things to tell her
