 he's a real nowhere man 
 sitting in his nowhere land 
 making all his nowhere plans for nobody 
 making all his nowhere plans for nobody 
 making all his nowhere plans for nobody 
 making all his nowhere plans for nobody 
 making all his nowhere plans for nobody 
 making all his nowhere plans for nobody 
 making all his nowhere plans for nobody 
 making all his nowhere plans for nobody 
 making all his nowhere plans for nobody 
 making all his nowhere plans for nobody

 but she gets it while she can 
 
 i wanna be your man 
 i wanna be your man, i wanna be your lover baby 
 i wanna be your man, i wanna be your man 
 i wanna be your man 
 love is all, love is you 
 
 but till you've been 
 i will turn to me and start to cry 
 and all the fun 
 and all i gotta do is act naturally
