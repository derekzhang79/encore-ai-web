 yes you can imitate everyone you know 
 the number was you 
 so, come on home to find his music 
 and then he'll never come back, she's dressed in black 
 oh dear, what can i do? 
 baby's in black and i'm feeling blue 
 tell me, oh what can she be? 
 that she was meant just for me, oh, oh 
 
 yeah, you've been good to work it away 
 from the very start 
 that you would love me more than her 
 
 though tonight she's made me cry 
 
 got to be just like you want it to 
 because... 
 
 i begged her not to go out yeah 
 ooh! 
 
 my love don't give me presents 
 turn me on when i look into the eyes, that you won't see me you won't see her no more 
 oh not have me 
 yeah, soldier of love baby, lay down your arms soldier of love 
 too many tires 
 wipe the windows 
 check the tire 
 check the oil and all the gas 
 about our love 
 that is all you
