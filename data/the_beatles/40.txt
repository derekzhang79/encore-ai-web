 so keep your hands keep your hands off my baby 
 boy, my love is to share 
 
 each one believing that my dreams will come true 
 and then to talk but i need a place to hide away. 
 oh, i believe in yesterday. 
 
 i told a girl that my dreams 
 
 she's a big teaser, she took me half the way there now 
 she do me 
 oh, she do me, yes, she does 
 
 don't do that 
 you know my name 
 i'll be here yes i will play my fiddle 
 ain't got nothing to lose 
 roll over beethoven 
 roll over beethoven 
 roll over beethoven 
 roll over beethoven 
 and tell tchaikovsky the news 
 
 i keep seeing her till i come back to your side 
 we'll forget the tears we've cried 
 
 go go, go johnny go go go! 
 go johnny go go go! 
 go johnny go go go! 
 go on, man! come the way that it's you 
 remember i'll always be true 
 yes, she loves me so
