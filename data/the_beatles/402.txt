 i said i'm trav'ling on the one after 909 
 
 i got my bag, everything you see 
 
 i wanna be your man 
 love you like no other lover 
 something in the way she knows 
 and all i can hear, i me mine 
 even those tears, i me mine 
 i said i'm trav'ling on the one after 90 
 i said i'm trav'ling on the one after 909 
 i said move over once, move over twice 
 come on baby don't be cold as ice 
 i said i'm trav'ling on the one after 90 
 i said we're trav'ling on the one after 909 
 
 i used to get mad at my school no love is something you can't so she told me to sit anywhere 
 so i should have realized till i'm all down 
 when i'm in the middle of a dream 
 stay in bed, float up stream float up stream float up stream 
 
 everybody pulled their socks up 
 everybody put their foot down 
 oh yeah 
 
 well, i'll never used to
