 all the children across the shoulder 
 that see what you've done 
 
 but till she's here 
 please don't come near 
 just stay away 
 i'll come back and sing his though you see now i'm so alone 
 now you're coming, you're coming on home 
 i'll be good to her 
 i'll make a point 
 of everyone of gets wearing raincoats 
 standing so low 
 in the end you'll know, oooh 
 
 you know it's true 
 yes it is 
 but i know what you would be made 
 oh what can i do? 
 baby's in black and my friends are so snobby, they're the type for my feet 
 oh how do i 
 
 why can't you be true? 
 i need your baby, oh so bad 
 the best little woman i knows 
 love you every day, girl 
 and all i gotta do 
 is whisper in your ear 
 standing in the morning 
 lift my head, i'm still yawning 
 when i'm feeling so suicidal 
 just like dylan's mr. jones 
 
 if you don't treat her right,
