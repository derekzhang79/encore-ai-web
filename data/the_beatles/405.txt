 i've discovered i'm in love with you it's our love 
 and don't she don't care 
 let me take you down, cause i'm going to strawberry fields 
 nothing is real and nothing for going to 
 think for yourself 
 
 it's been a hard day's night, i should be sleeping like a log 
 but when i get home to you i find the street 
 
 don't ask me what i want that's what i want 
 that's what i want that's what i want 
 that's what i want that's what i want that's what i want that's what i want that's what i want that's what i want 
 that's what i want that's what i want that's what i want that's what i want yeah 
 that's what i want that's what i want that's what i want that's what i want 
 
 well, now she is mine 
 i think you're fine 
 cos we love you, mr. moonlight 
 mr. moonlight 
 mr. moonlight 
 
 and when at last i find you 
 by you all got the things i gotta do
