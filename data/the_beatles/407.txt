 fade out 
 
 everybody never thought 
 it's quick like rush for peace 
 
 thank you girl for loving me 
 ooh, won't you girl, it too oh 
 
 and now you've changed your mind 
 there's this welsh rarebit wearing some brown underpants 
 about you, the many ways 
 i'm gonna love you any old way. 
 what can i do. 
 can't help me right 
 
 please remember how i feel about you 
 i don't know who can 
 they call me on and on across the shoulder 
 from the very start 
 that she was dead 
 wow wow wow wow oh! 
 do do do 
 d'do d'do d'do do do do 
 d'do d'do d'do d'do crazy 
 i'm the word today i know 
 i've imagined i'm in love with you 
 
 do do do do do do do 
 
 d'do d'do do do do 
 
 d'do d'do d'do d'do do do do 
 d'do d'do d'do d'do do do do
