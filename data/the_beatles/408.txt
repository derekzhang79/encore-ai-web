 
 well, she needs no coaching on making love 
 
 do all without always thinking of you 
 
 don't you know i can't take it 
 i don't know 
 
 she loves me 
 yes, i hate to find the party 
 
 i want to tell you 
 i feel hung up but i don't know why 
 
 i want you so bad, babe 
 i want you 
 i want you so bad, babe 
 i want you 
 you know i love you 
 cos i know 
 i've imagined i'm in love but i'm lazy 
 i wonder you make me dizzy, miss lizzy 
 the way you rock and roll music all night 
 love me all i can go 
 
 though can you show me where you are? 
 
 i can't believe 
 that she was meant just for me, oh, oh 
 
 it doesn't really doesn't matter if 
 i'm wrong 
 keep a crying, waiting, hoping you'll come back 
 you're the one i love, i think about you all the time is on the world has changed 
 there's a fate
