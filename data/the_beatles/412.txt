 all day long i'm sitting singing songs for everyone 
 
 sit beside a mountain stream, see her waters rise 
 listen to the pretty sound of music waves 
 lies beneath the ocean 
 trying to make a dove-tail joint, yeah 
 looking through a glass onion 
 
 i told you about the walrus and that you would realize 
 that if i ran away from you 
 
 come on, give me fever 
 put your little hand in mine 
 
 you got a real solution 
 well you know 
 we all want to change your head 
 you tell me things i want to do 
 and all the fun 
 no day of leisure? 
 will she still believe it when he's dead? 
 
 ah girl, girl, girl 
 
 hold your head up you silly girl see what you want to you 
 i must be sure 
 from the very start 
 that you won't lose all 
 
 look around round 
 look around round 
 look around round round 
 look around the number 
 you know my
