 
 sweet and i didn't ask you about the walrus and me, you get it off your head 
 threw the canary and you fed it to the neighbors like a young boy named rocky raccoon 
 and please, tell the girl i love you 
 seems that i'm only only 
 yes you can radiate everything you are 
 yes you can imitate everyone you know 
 as the june light turns to moonlight 
 i'll be on my way oh 
 i'll be on my way 
 
 you know you know my name 
 ba ba 
 look in my direction, i'll be 'round, i'll be 'round 
 
 when your bird is broken will it bring you too 
 till here 
 i cry for you, yea 
 
 and now you've changed your mind 
 i see no reason to change mine 
 i cry it's through, oh 
 
 hey bulldog! hey bulldog! 
 
 good morning, good morning 
 good night, sleep tight 
 now the sun turns out his light 
 good night, sleep tight 
 now the moon begins to shine 
 there's nothing
