 i want you 
 i want you 
 i want you so bad 
 it's driving me mad 
 it's a love that had no past seeking past 
 i'm looking through you, and you're nowhere 
 
 why, tell me in sweet fragrant meadows 
 of dawn and dew 
 
 there was love all around these... 
 
 chains, my baby's been gone 
 
 ah, ah, ah, ah 
 
 man you been a naughty girl, man 
 you know how hard it can be 
 someone is speaking but she doesn't know he's there 
 
 i can't forget the time or place 
 no one there to hide 
 the way things are going 
 they're going to crucify me 
 
 saving up to buy some you'd go

 [john:] you're joking! 
 [lee:] no? 
 [paul:] la?

 baby you can drive my car 
 yes i'm gonna be a star 
 baby you can drive
