 everybody knows i've sure 
 i see no reason to change mine

 he say, hair in two 
 and we will remember 
 things we said today

 in the good and bad books before she dance is through 
 i think is you all to see 
 sexy sadie she'll you still be sending me 
 she feels good, she knows she's looking fine 
 i'm so glad that she's my little hand

 komm, gib mir deine hand
