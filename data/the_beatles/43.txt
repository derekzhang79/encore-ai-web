 sch√∂n wie ein diamant 
 ich johnny b. dream 
 everybody had a roll time for me 
 shine it turns to moonlight 
 i'll be on my way oh 
 i'll be on my way oh 
 i'll be on my way 
 
 just treats me right 
 never runnin' in the streets 
 leave me alone 
 don't bother me 
 
 i can't believe 
 that she would leave 
 it's all the little piggies 
 life is getting worse 
 always having dirt to play around in 
 
 and when i ask you to be my bride 
 everything about you 
 i don't know why 
 i don't mind 
 shine, the weather's fine 
 
 i can show you 
 
 rain, i don't mind 
 shine, the weather's fine 
 
 i can feel all right 
 why can make me feel alright owww 
 
 so i looked around and i noticed there wasn't a chair 
 
 i sat on the rug, biding my time, drinking her all all and hold me tight, tonight, tonight 
 take your time, don't hurry 
 leave it all till
