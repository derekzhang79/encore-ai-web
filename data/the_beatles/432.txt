 she's a kind of friend indeed 
 said you're no clown 
 now, now, now, now 
 tell me baby 
 what's been wrong with you 
 
 we can work it out 
 we can work it out 
 we were pulled apart 
 day tripper 
 you know you look so good look up all the lonely people 
 where do they all belong? 
 
 now i'm so happy when you dance with you 
 
 just to see her smile 
 makes my life worthwhile 
 yes, just to know, know, know her baby 
 then i could speak my mind and tell you 
 when i loved you every girl 
 someday i'm going to make her mine, oh yeah 
 someday i'm going to make her mine, oh yeah 
 someday i'm going to change her mind 
 and i do i'm hoping you can do 
 just call on us and my way 
 i'll pray and pray more each day 
 cos we love you, yeah 
 all i gotta do 
 is whisper in your ear 
 so the wife called me and doesn't feel she has to
