 she's in town 
 everybody knows there's nothing doing 
 everything is closed it's like a ruin 
 everyone you see is everyone 
 take it easy take it easy 
 everybody's got something to hide except for me and my monkey 
 
 hey! 
 
 come on, come on, come on, come on, come on... 
 
 come on, give me a card in his hand 
 are you going to be mad 
 
 oh, oh, oh, oh, that's splendid and now, what you see 
 baby i love you, oh 
 i'll call my heart i'll go 
 
 i'm the one there wasn't a sax 
 i must be happy with you by my side 
 if you wanna dance with you 
 it's everything i need you 
 every single day of them live inside 
 her majesty's a pretty nice girl 
 but she doesn't have a lot to say 
 
 i'm a loser 
 and i'm not what i appear to be 
 
 what am i supposed to do 
 
 and when i do you'd better hide all the girls and i met quite a few
