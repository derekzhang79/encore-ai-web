 now i'm so happy i found out 
 
 she's a big teaser, she took me half the way there now 
 she was a day tripper, a sunday driver yeah 
 it took me so long 
 i let you share what's your feet 
 wonder how you won't see the banker sitting all and know 
 but now you got a boyfriend down the street 
 there's got nothing but love, babe 
 eight days a week 
 eight awake you when you rise 
 sleep, pretty darling, do not cry 
 and i will sing a lullaby 
 
 golden slumbers fill your eyes 
 cos i'm the dead of within 
 it makes me your face 
 
 i took one look at the world and i like to stop but i know what i want 
 love you forever and forever 
 love you with all the little piggies 
 life is getting dark 
 everyone you see is you 
 silly girl 
 
 every little thing 
 
 give it to me hark the head 
 see how they smile 
 never read my friend to bed? 
 pink, brown,
