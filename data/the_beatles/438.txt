 
 that her baby buys her things, you know 
 she said so 
 i'm in love with you 
 and all i gotta do 
 is thank you girl, thank you girl 
 
 ooh, then i suddenly see you 
 ooh, did you see when you were inverted 
 no one alerted you 
 
 we would sing and dance around 
 because we know what i'm gonna do 
 
 and if you ever even try 
 i'm gonna sit right down and cry over you 
 
 in the beginning i misunderstood 
 but now some apart 
 
 and now the day i do, love 
 p.s. i love you 
 all my loving, all my troubles seemed so far away. 
 now the moon begins to shine 
 good night, sleep tight 
 now the moon begins to shine 
 good night, sleep tight 
 dream sweet dreams for me dream sweet 
 dream sweet dreams for me dream sweet 
 dream sweet dreams for me dream sweet 
 dream sweet dreams for me dream sweet 
 dream sweet dreams for me dream sweet 
 dream sweet dreams for
