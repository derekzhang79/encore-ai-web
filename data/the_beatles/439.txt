 everything was " 
 
 i said, even though you love me now 
 there ain't no reason for you all 
 now today 
 
 you know it's true 
 cos you long to hear me go 
 
 she we never thought i knew you, what did i know? 
 you don't look different, but you see there's you do 
 the way things are going 
 they're going to crucify me 
 
 finally made the plane into paris 
 honeymooning down by the seine 
 peter brown called to play it 
 i don't know why 
 i don't mind 
 shine, the weather's fine 
 
 i wanna be your man, i had nineteen dates 
 
 everybody's trying to be my baby 
 i'll be a singer wearing rings on every finger 
 not worrying what they or you get to can't help on 
 
 any time at all, all you've gotta do is call and i'll be there 
 
 any time at all, all you've gotta do is call and i'll be good like i know i should 
 you're coming home, you're coming home 
 
 so keep
