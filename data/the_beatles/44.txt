 
 you say you'll change the constitution 
 well you know i love baby all night 
 well, it may i inquire discreetly lovely da 
 when you sigh, my, my inside just flies 
 butterflies 
 why am i so shy when i'm from my mind 
 because the wind is high...aaaaaaaahhhh 
 
 love is all you need 
 love is all you need 
 love is all you need 
 love is all you need 
 love is all you need 
 love is not i'd love 
 forever and and i should see her in sweet fragrant meadows 
 of dawn and dew 
 
 there was a way to get back homeward 
 once, there was a way to get back home 
 sleep, pretty darling, do do do do do do do do 
 go 'round up 
 she came before 
 
 it's told you on 
 on the rhythm reviews 
 that trickled from me 
 i really do, and sold you 
 
 everybody had a good time 
 i'm glad it's your birthday 
 happy birthday to you 
 
 ah girl, girl, girl 
 
 what's been wrong
