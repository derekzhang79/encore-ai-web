 so go away and leave me alone 
 don't bother me 
 don't bother me 
 don't bother me 
 
 i don't know how someone controlled you 
 they bought 
 but if you talk with me 
 
 i don't know why you say goodbye 
 hello goodbye hello hello 
 hello goodbye hello hello 
 hello hello hello hello 
 hello goodbye hello hello 
 hello hello 
 hello goodbye hello hello 
 hello goodbye hello hello 
 hello goodbye hello goodbye hello hello 
 hello goodbye hello hello 
 hello goodbye hello goodbye hello hello hello hello hello 
 hello goodbye hello hello 
 hello goodbye hello hello hello hello 
 
 hela heba helloa 
 hela heba helloa, cha cah cah [fade out] 
 and if you leave me 
 
 many times i've been alone, and many times i've cried 
 any way you'll never know, the many ways i've tried 
 and to live alone 
 painting pictures for the childrens holiday 
 
 cry baby i'm down 
 
 baby you can drive my car 
 yes i'm lonely wanna die 
 yes i'm lonely wanna die 
 yes i'm lonely
