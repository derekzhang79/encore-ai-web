 you can talk to me 
 hey! 
 
 bulldog! 
 
 friday night arrives without a suitcase 
 sunday morning creeping like a nun 
 monday's child 
 some kind of innocence is measured out in you 
 you think you can feel 
 listen to me 
 fixing a hole in the ocean 
 trying to make a dove-tail joint, yeah 
 looking through a glass onion 
 
 well, well, you're feeling fine 
 i've got to admit it's getting better (better) 
 it's getting better since you've been gone 
 say he won't do know what i mean 
 
 i told her i didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath 
 
 and when the sun shines down 
 and sip their lemonade 
 when the sun shines 
 
 rain, keep me wait), lead me to your door 
 the wild and windy night, that the rain, washed away 
 has left a pool of kids running in the yard 
 of desmond and molly jones 
 ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! 
 
 you've got a woman way cross
