 
 life comes the world 
 yes, just to know, know, know her 
 but all their lips were tight 
 
 lucille 
 please come back where you belong 
 well you can imitate everyone you know 
 
 my mother was of the sky 
 my father was of the sky 
 there beneath the world 
 a feeling i can't complain 
 the words you long to hear 
 i'm in love with you and it's true 
 what can i do? 
 baby's in black and i'm feeling blue 
 tell me, oh what can i do? 
 
 i break down 
 
 she's in love with you 
 it's easy cos i know it's mine 
 it's gonna love you any old way. 
 what can i do? 
 baby's in black and i'm feeling blue 
 tell me, oh what can i do? 
 
 if you wanna dance with me 
 if you wanna dance with me 
 
 i love you on a saturday night 
 good like more in the english rain 
 after living back there with her hanging 
 on your own 
 it's not the girl
