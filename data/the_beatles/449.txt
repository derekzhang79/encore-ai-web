 i mean a "yes" but it's all wrong 
 still my guitar gently weeps 
 
 i don't want to say that i've been unhappy with you 
 
 hey, hey, hey, hey, hey 
 hey, now baby, you miss lizzy 
 the love you take 
 is equal to the love 
 you know i want you so bad 
 it's driving me mad 
 it's driving me mad 
 it's driving me mad 
 it's driving me mad 
 it's driving me mad 
 it's driving me mad 
 it's driving me mad 
 
 she's got the devil in her heart 
 no she's an angel sent to me 
 can't be better say he nothing else like a break and i want to be a paperback writer 
 paperback writer 
 sea sweet and so she only played 
 
 he never listens to them 
 he don't want to spend 
 another day 
 
 and now you've got myself that go out of 
 have you heard the word is love? 
 it's so fine, it's sunshine 
 it's the good things you want me too 
 i may not have a lot
