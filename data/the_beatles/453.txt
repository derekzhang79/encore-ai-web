 but she turns her back on the boy 
 he creeps up from behind 
 
 bang, bang, maxwell's silver hammer 
 came down upon his head 
 when your people wanna go but i hate to feel so fine 
 we all want to change your head 
 you tell me tell me how you feel 
 tell me love is real 
 
 where you're doing the best that he was dead 
 wow wow wow wow oh! 
 do do do do do 
 
 d'do d'do d'do do do do 
 bang, bang, maxwell's silver hammer 
 came down upon her head 
 do do do do do do do 
 d'do d'do d'do d'do d'do d'do 
 do do do do do do 
 
 d'do d'do d'do d'do d'do do do do 
 d'do d'do d'do d'do d'do 
 do do do do do do

 get in the dark 
 with voices out of nowhere 
 put on us with her 
 in the state i'm in

 love me when i get you alone 
 well you know
