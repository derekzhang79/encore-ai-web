 i'd like to be under the sea 
 and of course henry the horse dances the waltz! 
 
 the band begins at ten to six 
 when i'm with her i'm happy just to know that she loves me now 
 there is one thing i'm sure of day 
 
 i'm a loser 
 and i'm not what i appear to be 
 you'll say it's all right 
 talking for all to see 
 when you smile? 
 
 child-like 
 no one i think is in my tree 
 i got a whole lot of things to tell her 
 i'd really like to go 
 soon will be the same now, i'm telling you 
 
 hey, hey, hey, and i ever ever 
 this boy would be happy 
 just call on us and we'll send it along 
 with love from us to you 
 
 hold my hands through her hair yip yip boom 
 i tried to telephone 
 they said you were to say "love"
