 don't you know that it's so 
 there'll be no sad tomorrow 
 don't you know it's true 
 yes it is, yes it can be 
 i can't know you would upset me? 
 i can work it out 
 we can work it out and i will sing a lullaby 
 
 once, there was a way to get back homeward 
 once, there was a way to get back home 
 sleep, pretty darling, do not cry 
 and i will sing a lullaby 
 
 once, there was a way to get back home 
 sleep, pretty darling, do not cry 
 and i will sing a lullaby 
 
 golden slumbers fill your eyes 
 cos i'm the good 
 
 i'm not goin' to mayayake it 
 i'm not that kind of man

 ooh i love you 
 
 a, b, c, d 
 can i bring my friend to tea? 
 e, f, g, h, i, j, i love you 
 
 bom bom bom bompa bom sail the ship
