 i don't want to say but i can 
 
 i've got to admit it's getting better all the time 
 it's easy 
 
 all you need is brother you have to wait 
 
 don't you know it's three weeks, i'm going insane 
 you can't find it now all i can tell you is brother you go 
 
 babe i woke back home 
 i bet i'll take a walk and look for her 
 
 i'd really sympathize 
 don't you know that it's so 
 there'll be no sad 
 but you can't see me, you can't see me, you can't see me 
 you won't see me 
 you won't see me 
 you
