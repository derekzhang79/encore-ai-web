 if i'd been out till quarter to three 
 would you lock love with me 
 love me do 
 you and i say hello 
 hello hello 
 hello hello 
 hello hello 
 i don't know why 
 i hide myself away, ay hay 
 or for the many ways at all the lonely people 
 where do they all come from? 
 all the man for the friends i want you so bad, babe 
 i want you to 
 remember that love 
 and if you get to the bottom i go back to the top of the slide 
 and i stop and i hear them say 
 
 everywhere 
 well you can sing that something 
 i don't know, i don't it take a look? 
 it's the word i'm thinking of 
 and that she only played like a yellow dog, oh now 
 some and nothing to do 
 than to be with another man 
 ooh oh oh oh oh 
 but you can't hear me, you can't see me 
 
 i don't know how you were inverted 
 no need to make complaining
