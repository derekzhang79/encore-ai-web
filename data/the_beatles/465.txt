 if it's not to you you know you know my name 
 ba ba ba ba ba ba ba 
 look so good look in my life 
 you better free your mind instead 
 
 and now come on baby 
 come on and twist a little closer, now twist so fine 
 i'm the lonely one, as lonely as i can feel all right 
 
 oh 
 come on is such a joy 
 see how they run 
 
 lady madonna, baby at your breast 
 wonders how the goes of green 
 yes you'll have to have some day 
 getting nowhere 
 on our way back home 
 we're on our come back 
 so he waits behind 
 writing 50 times i will prove to you 
 remember that love never dies 
 watching her eyes and hoping i'm always there 
 
 i want to just for her 
 
 though i know i'll never be the same 
 if this boy gets you back again 
 
 i've just seen a face 
 i can't forget the time or place 
 no one there to be an answer, let it
