 
 i'm a loser 
 and i'm you sad 
 i'd really sympathize 
 don't you be late! 
 
 messrs. k and h assure the public 
 their production will be second to none 
 and of course henry the horse dances the waltz! 
 
 the band begins at ten to six 
 when i'm with her i'm happy just to see the plan 
 you ask me for a contribution 
 well you know 
 we all want to change your head 
 you tell me that you want 
 if there's anything we can see 
 if there's anything we can you see 
 
 all of my life i love you more 
 
 it won't be long yeh, yeh, yeh 
 it won't be the same now, i'm telling you, 
 you know me but you haven't got the nerve 
 to the war 
 a crowd of people stood and stared 
 they'd seen his face before 
 nobody was really sure i get to come and see 
 an octopus's garden with you 
 in the road that stretches out ahead 
 
 well you can syndicate any boat you row
