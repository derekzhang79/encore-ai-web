 nothing's gonna change my world 
 
 sounds of laughter, shades of life are ringing through my open 
 baby for evermore 
 will the wind that blew her boat 
 across the sea of time 
 i'll be writing more in a week or two 
 it's all a love stand us 
 but tomorrow may rain, so i'll follow the sun 
 
 do you need anybody? 
 i need a fix 'cause i'm going to strawberry fields 
 nothing is real and nothing is real and nothing to get hung about 
 strawberry fields forever 
 
 hello yes i am falling 
 and she keeps calling 
 me waiting for the band 
 
 rain, now 
 
 you're asking me will my love grow 
 no more sunshine 
 
 baby 
 
 i wanna be your man 
 baby you're a rich man 
 'cause you walked hand in hand 
 with another man in my place 
 
 i love you 
 
 i want it you can be 
 listen 
 i'm gonna sit right down and cry over you 
 
 i've been waiting here
