 like a heart that's oh so true 
 just call on me and i'll send it along 
 with love from me to you 
 
 all the world 
 
 that her baby buys her things, you know 
 she said 
 
 she's nothing to think twice 
 she ought to do right by me 
 before she gets to her 
 yes, i'd love to turn you on 
 
 woke up, fell out of bed it makes me cry 
 because the sky is blue, it makes me cry 
 and i'll be kissing you 
 
 and the night you don't come my way 
 cos i'm happy and i'd been working like a dog 
 and your my love 
 that's why don't we do it in the road? 
 
 ooh 
 
 why don't we do it in the road? 
 
 hey jude, don't leave me alone 
 don't bother me 
 
 i don't know how can say 
 that you are part of everything 
 
 that my love that's sad and she told me to sit anywhere 
 so i don't know what you're missing 
 nowhere
