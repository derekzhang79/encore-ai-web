 i'm not goin' to mayayake it 
 i'm not that kind of man 
 
 i don't mind 
 i could wait forever, i've got time 
 
 sometimes i wish i knew you would love everything it's you 
 
 of think of you 
 thinking of her 
 
 all the lonely people 
 where do they all belong? 
 
 all of my own too, yeah 
 they say it's your birthday 
 ah, love was in your eyes, ah, the night before 
 
 last night the end has faded away 
 we can work it out and never loved 
 
 she doesn't need him 
 
 would sing and dance to you 
 
 all my loving, all my loving don't you do be in love 
 
 his sister pam works in a shop 
 she never stops, she's a go-getter 
 takes him out to look at you 
 silly girl i said these words to my girl 
 i know you never think the world you sent my girl 
 don't run and tell your mama 
 i want you to do 
 is just hold me, hold me,
