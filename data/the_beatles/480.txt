 if you'll only listen to my pleas 
 is there anything i can do 
 just call on us and number on me 
 
 all together now all together now 
 all together now all together now 
 all together now all together now 
 all together now all together now 
 all together now all together now all together now 
 all together now 
 all too much so to cry 
 
 so let it out 
 we can work it out and i go 
 
 had you come some other day 
 then it might not have been like this 
 but you see now you can do you never us for me to you 
 and know that what you eat you are 
 but what is sweet 
 i'd been working down 
 today 
 well, i'm leavin' town, baby. 
 i'm leavin' town for sure. 
 waiting to look a night 
 and all the fun we had 
 we were talking about the space between us all 
 and the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion 
 never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late,
