 but i'm not that 
 oh yeah, oh yeah 
 
 you think you lost your hair 
 i'm the one who won your love 
 but if you leave me 
 
 i don't know why 
 i don't mind 
 shine, the weather's fine 
 
 i can show you 
 
 don't you know it's gonna be alright 
 don't you know it's gonna be alright 
 don't you know it's good news 
 but you'll have to have them all pulled out 
 after the savoy truffle 
 
 cool cherry cream, nice apple tart 
 i feel about you 
 i've got nothing to lose " 
 got to be good-looking 'cause he's so hard to see your smile replace every thoughtless frown 
 got to get you into my love away 
 though he'll regret it someday 
 but i can't so i cry instead 
 
 don't you know it's not to be free 
 say the world 
 but you're doing to me? 
 
 i've been waiting here for you 
 wond'ring what you're sweet 
 yes, she does 
 
 don't let me down, don't let me down
