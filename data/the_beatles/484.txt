 [brian:] all right, stop the band. oh, that's splendid 
 now, what you see 
 
 listen to the music playing in your head 
 
 tuesday afternoon is never ending 
 wednesday morning papers didn't come 
 thursday night your stocking needed mending 
 see how they run 
 
 lady madonna, baby at your breast 
 wonders how you manage to make ends meet 
 who finds me too 
 i might 
 never be the lonely one 
 so hold me tight 
 let me go

 alright, alright
