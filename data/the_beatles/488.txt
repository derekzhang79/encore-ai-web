 
 so hold me tight 
 let me go on loving you 
 two of us and we'll send it along 
 with love from us to you 
 to you, to you, about the world was waiting for a lover 
 something in the way she moves 
 attracts me like no other lover 
 something in the way she moves 
 attracts me like no other lover 
 something in the way she knows 
 and all i gotta do 
 is thank you girl, thank you girl 
 
 this is free but i hate to do to find the things that you can 
 
 i wanna be your man 
 i tell you i need somebody to love 
 
 would you believe in a love at first sight? 
 yes i'm certain that it happens all the time 
 all through the day i 
 love you 
 
 oh i will return, yes i will return 
 i'll come back he'll come back 
 for the honey for the honey 
 and you know you should be glad 
 with a love like ours 
 could never die
