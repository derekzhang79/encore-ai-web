 some other guy now, she was the kiss that awoke my heart 
 there lingers still, though i've was a man in a couple that shine 
 dark is the sky 
 i know this boy would be happy 
 just in the middle of the celebrations 
 i break down 
 
 oh 
 
 a taste of honey 
 tasting much sweeter than wine 
 all through your life i me mine 
 so captain marvel zapped in right between the own of the eyes, zap! 
 all the lonely people ah, look at all the lonely people 
 where do they all come from? 
 all the lonely people 
 where do they all belong? 
 
 i've got to learn to dance 
 if you won't see me you won't see me 
 you won't see me you take me right 
 and then and then i might 
 never be the lonely one 
 so many days you passed back by 
 in the state i had a dreadful flight 
 i'm back in the u.s.s.r. 
 you don't know how lucky you are boy 
 back in the u.s. 
 back in
