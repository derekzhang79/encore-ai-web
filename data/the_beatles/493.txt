 mother mary comes to stay? 
 she will never be apart if i'm part 
 i can never win 
 hearing them, seeing them 
 in the state that long to heaven 
 and i'm a 
 long way from home 
 i'm making me feel alright 
 
 i love you on a saturday night 
 living here 
 i'm gonna sit right down and cry over you 
 it feels so right now 
 
 hold me, hold me out for me to you
