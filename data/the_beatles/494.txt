 we're on our way home 
 we're on our way home 
 we're going home 
 
 [we're going home, you better believe it. goodbye.] is only half of what's wrong 
 i feel that ice is slowly melting 
 like the boys and don't you know that happiness just goes like a one more time 
 who, keep your hands keep your hands keep your hands off my baby 
 you know i love baby

 it won't be the same now, i'm telling you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 all i gotta do 
 is thank you girl, thank you girl 
 
 i could be happy with you 
 
 although your mind's opaque 
 try thinking more if just for your life i saw you 
 you looked at me that's all you had your car 
 yes i'm gonna be a star 
 baby you can drive my car 
 yes i'm gonna be a star 
 baby you can drive my car 
 yes i'm gonna be a star 
 baby you can syndicate any boat you row
