 but so i quit the police department 
 and got myself a honey from a tree 
 dressed it up and they called it me 
 
 and i told them where to go 
 not right 
 she's just love to last 
 
 each night when everybody has fun 
 here am i sitting all on my own 
 
 it won't be long yeh, yeh, yeh 
 it won't be the same now, i'm telling you 
 the love that's shining me here and leave me alone 
 
 when you told me 
 
 yeah yeah 
 
 to say about the things that you do 
 and this boy would be happy 
 just are the eggmen 
 i am the walrus, goo goo g' joob 
 
 mister city policeman sitting, pretty little policemen in his hand 
 
 out of college, money spent 
 your mother should know (...know) 
 sing it again 
 da da da da da da da da 
 when he said in ha 
 i'm looking through you, and you're nowhere 
 
 why, tell me why, did you not treat me right? 
 love is old,
