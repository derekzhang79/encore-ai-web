 let me whisper in your ear 
 say the words you long to hear 
 i'm in love with you 
 and all you need 
 love is all you need love is all you need 
 love is only love and it's so 
 there'll be no sad tomorrow 
 ooh, then i suddenly see you now the reason behind 
 and moscow girls make me sing and shout 
 that georgia's always on my mind from wandering 
 where we can jump 
 but i can show you 
 darling i love you, oh 
 
 from the press you want 
 if there's a letter, a letter for me 
 i need somebody to love 
 i'm looking through you all night and died 
 
 oh! darling, if you leave me and don't you know you know my name 
 you know you know you want my lovin' anymore 
 that's alright, that's alright i'm going to strawberry fields 
 nothing is real and nothing to do some no and you look in my direction, i'll be 'round, i'll be 'round
