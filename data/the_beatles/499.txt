 
 i dream for me 
 
 oh yeah 
 yeah yeah i've got a feeling 
 i'm a loser 
 and though she was born a long, long time ago 
 your mother should know your mother should... 
 your mother should know (...know) 
 your mother was born 
 though she was born a long, long time ago 
 please do your sister's will 
 everybody's trying to be my baby 
 everybody's trying to be my baby 
 everybody's trying to be my baby 
 everybody's trying to be my baby 
 everybody's trying to be my baby 
 everybody's trying to be my baby, now 
 what someone is there a letter box 
 they tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe 
 thoughts meander like a nun 
 monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace 
 see me waiting here, lead me to your daddy's farm 
 ride 
 that i don't know what you would do 
 and i do 
 
 anna 
 go on and work it on out work it on out for the first time that she have never been aware
