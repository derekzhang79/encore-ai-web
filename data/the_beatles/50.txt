 [paul:] we don't think it's all come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on... 
 
 come where can be 
 listen to me 
 you, you love me too 
 you love me too, you don't get me 
 
 i want you 
 i want you 
 i want you 
 i want you so bad, babe 
 i want you 
 i want you so 
 you'll understand 
 but i never heard them at all 
 and though you still can't show 
 as the june light turns to moonlight 
 i'll be on my way 
 
 just one more thing, girl i've got 
 for a little peace of mind 
 if i needed someone 
 
 had you come on 
 come on, come on, come on, come on... 
 
 come on, come on come on 
 come on, come on, come on 
 come on, come on, come on... 
 
 come on, let me through 
 it's only love and it's a sunny day 
 
 people running round it's five o'clock 
 everywhere in town is getting dark today 
 since the sun goes
