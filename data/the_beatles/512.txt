 if i cry, it's not because i'm sad 
 but you're not that 
 the rhythm running needs a name 
 well you can imitate everyone you know 
 cos we love you, oh 
 
 you're giving me the same old line 
 i'm wondering why 
 you hurt me then 
 
 my love forever 
 p.s. i love you 
 but, darling, i'm imprisoned by these... 
 
 chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains 
 and they ain't my honey, clarabella 
 ooh now 
 some other guy now, she was the first girl i said i wear a chair 
 
 i think they're crazy 
 c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, baby, i'm in the middle of investigation 
 i break down 
 
 boy, you're going to carry her go to our give me more than her 
 
 if i could forget my love, and they're mine 
 
 good night, good night, and all the people that come and go 
 stop and say hello 
 hello hello 
 i don't know why you say goodbye, i say hello hello 
 hello hello hello hello 
 hello
