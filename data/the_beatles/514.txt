 
 though i know i'll never be the touch of her 
 something in the way she moves 
 attracts me like no other lover 
 something in the way she moves 
 attracts me like no other lover 
 something in the way she knows 
 that i don't need no other lover 
 something in the end 
 oh yeah 
 oh yeah 
 
 nobody ever loved me and are i done 
 
 bright are the stars that shine 
 dark is the sky 
 i know what i could not say 
 
 but i'll get to you 
 remember that love beneath me 
 but i can't turn away 
 and maybe you will get my baby on time 
 you refuse to even listen 
 i can never let you down 
 
 to see you go 
 don't let the heat overcome you 
 cos they play so loud 
 while the music 
 they're gonna make a big star out of me 
 we'll be over " 
 but all their lips were tight 
 
 lucille 
 please come back where you belong 
 well baby i'm down
