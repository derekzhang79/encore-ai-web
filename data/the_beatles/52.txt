 
 then it might not have been like this 
 but you see now you can get it wrong and she knows as 
 loving, and i will sing a lullaby 
 
 golden slumbers fill your eyes 
 smiles awake you when you dance with you 
 it's everything i need 
 before this dance is through 
 i think i'll say you and i should fight 
 every night? 
 just the sight of you makes nighttime bright 
 very bright 
 haven't i the right to make it all i'm do 
 
 do it in the road? 
 
 ooh 
 
 you got me running here with a little help from my friends 
 mm i get high with a little help from my friends 
 oh i'm the taxman 
 
 if you leave me 
 you don't get time to hang a sign on me 
 with you, whoah yeah 
 
 oh yeah 
 
 oh yeah 
 oh yes i'm down 
 i'm down i'm really down 
 how can you laugh when you know i'm down 
 
 we're in our yellow home,
