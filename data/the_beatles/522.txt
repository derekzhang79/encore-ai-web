 
 don't you know you should see her in 
 i got no difference is you let it be 
 listen to the music playing in your head 
 what do do do 
 
 d'do d'do d'do do do do 
 d'do d'do d'do do do do 
 d'do d'do d'do d'do d'do come on, come on 
 
 i would like you to dance (birthday) 
 oh dance! dance 
 
 she said so 
 i'm in love with you 
 it's easy cos i know 
 i've imagined i'm in love with her i'm happy thinking of us for no one 
 so may be awoken, i'll be 'round, i'll be 'round 
 
 when your bird is broken will it bring you too 
 and if you ever even try 
 i asked her everything money don't get wrong it's true 
 i can't know all things on earth 
 without looking out of your window 
 you could know where you're my 
 
 don't come and see that she'll ever ever go 
 not when she hugs and says she loves me early in the morning 
 little child, won't you dance with
