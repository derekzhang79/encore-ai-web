 it's my birthday too, yeah 
 they say it's your birthday 
 it's time to draw the line 
 
 keep your hands keep your hands keep your hands keep your hands keep your hands off my baby don't care 
 my baby don't care, my baby don't care 
 you better run for your own sake 
 the future nature's son 
 swaying daises sing a lazy song beneath the sun 
 
 i'd ask my friends to come and see 
 an back again 
 because i know you 
 
 i love you, honey pie you are driving me frantic 
 knows 
 they don't leave me alone 
 
 when i cannot sing my heart 
 i do all the pleasing with you, it's so better (better) 
 a little better all the time it can't get more worse 
 i have to have them all pulled out 
 after the savoy truffle 
 
 you might not feel it now 
 but every girl i've ever had 
 
 i can't forget the time or place 
 and if the rhythm finally gets you 
 remember you love 
 
 do you need anybody?
