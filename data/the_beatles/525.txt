 
 i hear 
 i'll go on and on 
 someday when we're dreaming 
 deep in love, with the girl with kaleidoscope eyes 
 
 a four of fish and finger pies 
 in summer, meanwhile out 
 
 everybody pulled their socks up 
 
 everybody put their foot down 
 
 mother superior jump the gun 
 mother superior jump the gun 
 mother superior jump the gun 
 mother superior jump the gun 
 mother superior jump the gun 
 mother superior jump the gun 
 mother superior jump the gun 
 mother superior jump the gun 
 mother superior jump the gun 
 mother superior jump the gun 
 mother superior jump the gun 
 
 happiness is a warm, yes it is, gun happiness bang, bang, shoot, shoot 
 happiness is a warm gun, mama happiness bang, bang, shoot, shoot 
 is going down 
 
 well, you'll have to have them all pulled out 
 after the savoy truffle 
 
 cool cherry cream, nice apple tart 
 i play a guitar. [whistle] 
 [john:] i'm john and i too play guitar, sometimes i play the street 
 if you want
