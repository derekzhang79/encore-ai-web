 i love you, oh 
 
 now i can only speak my mind, julia 
 
 julia, julia, morning moon, touch me 
 so i got a whole lot of things to tell her 
 when i walk out it's your window 
 
 i'm a loser 
 and i'm not what i appear to be 
 
 what have i done 
 she was waving me goodbye 
 and i see you 
 ooh, did you make me goin', now got me goin' 
 just like i knew you would like you to dance (birthday) 
 oh dance! dance 
 
 she said so 
 i'm in love with you with our love, your feet
