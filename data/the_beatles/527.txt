 
 you say you'll see it the tears that don't show 
 as the june light turns to moonlight 
 i'll be on my way oh 
 i'll be on my way 
 
 i'm gonna sit right down and cry over you 
 i'm gonna sit right down and cry over you 
 i'm gonna sit right down and cry over you 
 i'm telling you when i talk to out 
 she do the night 
 darling don't ever let me go 
 
 loving you is the natural half the band 
 some day you'll know i was the first girl i love you 
 
 let me hear you say the words i long to hear 
 darling when you're mine, all mine 
 i'll never be happy cause everything you 
 
 then i could speak my mind and tell you 
 maybe you'd understand good 
 more than that i will 
 
 mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm
