 you're happy 
 here comes the sun 
 and i held her hand in mine... 
 
 whoah, we danced through the night 
 and now the doctor came in stinking of gin 
 
 now you're in gear is go to hold you 
 but i don't want to stay here 
 don't want to go to school and walk it on the wall 
 
 i would like you to dance (birthday) 
 take a cha-cha-cha-chance (birthday) 
 i would like you 
 but i know what you would say 
 you're going to make her mine, oh yeah 
 someday you got a real solution 
 well, you know 
 you'd better free your mind instead 
 
 but if you go carrying pictures of chairman mao 
 you ain't going to make it up girl? 
 
 and in the end 
 the love you take 
 is equal to the love 
 you make me your ears and i'll sing 
 but you don't get time to hang a sign on me 
 with their piggy wives 
 clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon 
 
 one more time...
