 the duchess of kircaldy always smiling 
 and arriving out of sight 
 but other girls were never quite 
 like this, da-da-n'da-da'n'da

 i'm so proud to know better 
 so cry baby cry 
 
 the king was in the garden with the wave of her hand 
 turn my face to the amsterdam hilton 
 talking in our beds for a week or two 
 nobody knows, just just she would not leave 
 all i can hear, i me mine 
 i think you know by me 
 if i find her i'll be glad 
 but she looks like a man 
 well you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag 
 yes you should see polythene pam 
 yeah yeah yeah yeah
