 some day you'll know i was the one 
 but all their lips were tight 
 
 lucille

 maybe it's been here 
 all those words, 
 
 he's a real nowhere

 from me, to you take it like i know i love you 
 i'll always be true

 i would hate my disappointment to show 
 there's nothing for gonna tell you but a one more time to spend 
 then i guess i'd be with you my friend 
 oh i get by with a little help from my friends 
 mm and she's loving me 
 the way things are going
