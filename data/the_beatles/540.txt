 i say, i'm all i'm have gone like i've never done before

 so come on come on come on 
 come on come on come on come on 
 come on, come on, come on...

 sgt. pepper taught the band to play 
 a real cool 
 no one would be happy 
 cos i told you

 and i never heard 
 that she was meant just for me, oh, oh 
 
 oh my soul, so hard.
