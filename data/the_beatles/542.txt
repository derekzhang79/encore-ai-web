 and so i quit the police department 
 and got myself a steady job but he wants to be a paperback writer

 have some fun tonight

 everything's the same 
 i never weep at night 
 i call your name 
 i call your name 
 but baby, after school 
 carry your books home, too 
 so come on come to back in the u.s.s.r.
