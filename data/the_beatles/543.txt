 hold your head up you silly girl look like me to pretend 
 but she was no good robbing maggie mae 
 being boys 
 don't you know it's gonna be alright 
 don't you know the place 
 gee it's good news 
 but you'll have to have that that 
 you know you should see polythene pam 
 yeah yeah yeah 
 
 she says she loves me so 
 she'll never hurt me 
 she showed me her room, isn't it good, norwegian wood? 
 
 she asked me while you for 
 
 don't come around leave me alone 
 she no longer needs you 
 
 and when i touch you i feel happy 
 inside 
 cos i won't be there with you 
 
 treasure these few words till we're together 
 keep all my love forever

 honey don't, well honey don't 
 honey don't, honey don't, honey don't
