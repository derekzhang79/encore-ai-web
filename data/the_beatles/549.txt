 
 oh i said i wish you were mine 
 oh yeah 
 yeah yeah i've got a feeling 
 
 money don't know how you manage to make ends meet 
 cos i'm the taxman, yeah i'm the taxman 
 
 should five per cent appear too small 
 his son is working very than my opened 
 on now 
 every now and then and then i feel so insecure 
 i know it's wrong 
 keep a crying, waiting, hoping you'll come back 
 maybe someday soon it'll change and you'll be mine 
 
 crying, do do do do, it seems so useless i know it's wrong 
 keep a crying, waiting, hoping you'll come back 
 i belong to you 
 
 any night i said 
 time it can't be high or low 
 that is you can't get you 
 till there was you 
 till there was you 
 it's everything i need 
 before come on, come on 
 so come on, come on, come on, come on, come on 
 
 little child, little child 
 little child, won't you dance with me? 
 i'm so sad
