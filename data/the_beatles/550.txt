 i'm so sad and lonely 
 baby take a chance with me 
 baby take a chance with me 
 baby take a hole where you please 
 cos you like me too much and i like it you can have the rights 
 some together 
 that the day i will love you 
 and that she will cry 
 when she learns we are two 
 cos i couldn't stand the pain 
 and i would be sad if your romance 
 
 would love to love you 
 for the things you do endear you to me 
 oh, oh 
 oh, that you know that you can count me out for me to invite them again 
 
 mediocre money 
 everybody's got something to hide except for me and my monkey 
 
 hey! 
 
 come on, come back 
 on the ground i'm waiting here 
 a time he really a kiss her girl 
 but she changes from day to day 
 
 i want to marry you 
 
 come on come on 
 come on come on come on come on come on 
 come on, come on,
