 
 falling, yes i am falling 
 and she keeps calling 
 me were those done 
 now give me money that's what i want, whoo 
 whoah, yeah, i wanna be free that's what i want, yeah that's right 
 oh oh 
 yeah baby do your sister's will 
 ah lucille 
 baby do your sister's will 
 well you went up and married 
 but i don't know why she's riding so high 
 she ought to think twice 
 she ought to do right by me 
 before she gets to saying goodbye 
 she ought to think twice 
 she ought to do right by me 
 
 i'll get to you somehow 
 until i write and dance to a song 
 that was a hit before your mother was born 
 though she was born a long, long time ago 
 your mother should know your mother should... 
 your mother should know your mother should... 
 your mother should know your mother should... 
 your mother should know your mother should... 
 your mother should know (...know) 
 sing it again 
 i'm happy just to know that she loves me
