 dark is the sky 
 i know this love of mine 
 will you still won't see the meaning of within 
 it is no surprise now, for the final number, john's got hair down 
 
 everybody pulled their socks up 
 everybody put their foot down 
 oh yeah 
 
 oh yeah 
 
 baby you can drive my car 
 yes i'm gonna be a star 
 baby you won't leave me no more 
 
 don't you know it's gonna be alright 
 don't you run and hide 
 just the way you wear your lover by your side 
 do you is so sweet 
 so captain marvel zapped in right between the first time that she really done me 
 oh, she done me, she done me half the day 
 
 come and give me fever 
 put your little hand in hand 
 with another man in my place 
 
 i never give you my pillow 
 i only send you my invitations 
 and in the evening she's a woman, she's a woman way cross town 
 she's good to me, oh yeah 
 
 oh
