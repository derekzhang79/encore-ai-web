 i'm in love with you 
 
 treasure these few words till we're together 
 keep all my love forever 
 p.s. i love you 
 
 oh i can't sleep at you all they seen the band will what you see 
 
 listen to me one more time, i think it's a sin 
 i say it's all right 
 
 little darling, it feels like years since it's been here 
 
 baby for your own sake 
 the future still looks good 
 and he wrote it on the wall 
 
 if you're doing the best that i can go 
 not to tell you 
 
 i'm so glad that she's my little girl 
 she's so glad, she's telling all those lies 
 about the good things that you do 
 she said so 
 i'm in love with her and i feel it now i can tell you is brother you have the way 
 it's the word 
 but a point, but what are you 
 gonna sing for us? 
 [john:] you really got a hold on me 
 you really got a hold on me
