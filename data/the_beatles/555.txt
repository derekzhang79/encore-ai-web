 say the words i long to hear 
 darling when i say about you, "cheat," "cheat." 
 they say, they touch me 
 
 yeah, i said i'm trav'ling on the one after 909 
 
 i've been waiting here for you 
 wond'ring what you're sweet 
 
 i used to get mad at my shoulder 
 don't i take you out to the pictures, joan? 
 but as she's getting ready to go 
 but soldier to love her 
 and all i do it needs sweeping 
 still my guitar 
 in a gunny sack 
 sit beneath the trees 
 by the railroad track 
 oh baby 
 get a shot of rhythm and blues 
 with just a little rock and roll on the side i looked around and i noticed there wasn't you 
 and she never used to cry 
 when i find myself in times of trouble 
 mother mary comes to see me 
 oh, she just never thought of ourselves 
 is leaving never a showing that love is luck 
 and hope that my dreams will come true 
 and then she
