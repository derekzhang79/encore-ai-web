 way they're past the flowers 
 now i'm coming back home 
 i've been away now 
 oh how, i've been like this 
 but you see now i'm too much a 
 too much a, too much a, waiting to sing a world, if they only knew right 
 ha ha ha, 
 wow oh! 
 do do do do do do 
 
 d'do d'do d'do do do do 
 d'do d'do d'do d'do d'do d'do do do do 
 
 d'do d'do d'do d'do do do do 
 
 d'do d'do d'do d'do do do do 
 d'do d'do d'do d'do d'do do do do 
 d'do d'do d'do d'do d'do 
 
 i'm not in the morning 
 lift my head, i'm still yawning 
 when i'm in the middle of a dream 
 stay in bed, float up stream float up stream 
 
 don't ask me how i feel 
 yes, is together sky of blue 
 and though he'll never come back, she's dressed in black 
 oh dear, what can i do? 
 
 you don't get time to hang a sign on me 
 if i won't be in the
