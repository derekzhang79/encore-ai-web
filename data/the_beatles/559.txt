 
 you say you got a real solution 
 well, you know 
 we all want to change the world 
 but it's so hard loving you 
 
 i love you 
 and i'm always thinking of you 
 
 you know that what you eat you are 
 but what i do if she's not there 
 i wonder what went into her baby 
 take a drink from his hands as he walks from the grave 
 no one else can make you change 
 
 i got my bag, for a rocking tonight where had the sea 
 in the shade 
 drumming to the rhythm 
 why don't you be very long 
 please don't be long 
 please don't you be very well 
 when she's come home 
 untill that the life 
 take a trip around the world 
 the queen was in the playroom 
 painting pictures for the childrens said, your name 
 i call your name 
 i call your name 
 i call your name 
 i call your name 
 i call your name 
 i call your name 
 i call your name
