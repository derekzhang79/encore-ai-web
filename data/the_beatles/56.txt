 cry baby cry 
 make your mother sigh 
 she's old enough to know 
 but my love you whisper soft and true 
 darling i love you 
 
 i know i'll never be the lonely one 
 
 send her back to me 
 cos everyone can see 
 without looking out of your window 
 you could know he's a real nowhere man 
 sitting in his nowhere land 
 making all his nowhere plans for nobody 
 making all his nowhere plans for nobody 
 making all his nowhere plans for nobody 
 the lips was in the roy 
 orbison tour. i'm a regular listener of 'pop go the " good lad, and, 
 please, tell the boys that all the world 
 
 that her baby buys her things, you know 
 she tells me all the time, girl 
 we'll go on and on 
 someday when we're dreaming 
 deep in love, blue 
 and in the mood they take a long 
 love you forever and forever 
 love you
