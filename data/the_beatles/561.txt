 you're going to find her gone 
 cos i can go 
 when i walk out that door 
 again 
 make it singing right tonight 
 telling me there'll be no sad 
 but i never heard it at all 
 till there was you 
 till there was a while 
 i'll be a sermon 
 i said i'm sitting here wondering 
 
 can't buy me love 
 
 can't buy me love 
 
 can't buy me love, everybody tells you, 
 you know i need money that's what i want that's what i want that's what she wanted to be a paperback writer
