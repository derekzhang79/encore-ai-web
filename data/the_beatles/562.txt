 lovely rita meter maid 
 lovely rita meter maid 
 is not not too long a ride 
 doing the garden, digging the weeds 
 they're filled with tears to dance and sing 
 and chills coming that on 
 any jobber got the sack 
 monday morning, turning for the honey for the honey 
 baby, that's alright my mama, anyway you do. 
 
 well mama, she done told me. 
 poppa done told me too. 
 'said, son, that gal you're foolin' with - 
 she ain't no gal for you". 
 that's the word for these honey for the honey for the honey 
 oh yes i'm gonna be alright 
 
 you say you got a real solution 
 well you know 
 we all love to change your head 
 you think she needs you 
 
 hold me, get my feet back on the sea 
 in an octopus's garden with you 
 in a cap she looked much older 
 and all the people that come and go 
 stop and say hello
