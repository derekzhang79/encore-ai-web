 
 crying, do do do do, it seems so useless i know it's wrong 
 keep a crying, waiting, hoping you'll come back 
 i just can't seem to get you off my mind 
 crying, waiting, hoping you'll come back 
 you're the one i love, i think about you all the time 
 
 hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me 
 tighter 
 tighter 
 tighter 
 
 make me here in misery 
 
 i'll be over when they been the street 
 there's so sad and lonely 
 baby take a chance with me 
 baby take a chance with me 
 baby take a chance with me 
 baby take a chance with me 
 baby take a chance with me 
 come on, give me fever 
 put your little hand in mine 
 oh yeah 
 oh yeah oh
