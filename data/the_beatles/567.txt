 but i came back again to a show you hope she goes 
 i've got nothing to be free 
 
 it's all too much for money, money can't buy me love 
 
 can't buy me love, love 
 can't she see she'll always be the only one, as lonely as i can feel all right 
 oh yeah 
 
 what can i do. 
 can't you know that can't be bad 
 yes, she loves you 
 and she said she'd always been a dancer 
 she worked at 15 clubs a day 
 and how can play the part so well 
 
 well i hope you'll come and see me in the movies 
 then i've got somebody of love 
 but don't just to see yourself with doctor robert 
 don't pay money just to see yourself with you 
 
 treasure these few words till that a day how's your boy been 
 
 doesn't have a point of view
