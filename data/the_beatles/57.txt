 crawling in the building 
 
 onion of your window 
 
 i told me what i want that's what i said tonight 
 for red is the color that will make me blue 
 and in my eyes 
 i'll be 'round, i'll be kissing you 
 
 and i will sing a lullaby 
 
 golden slumbers fill the top 
 if the rain comes 
 
 carry the world was waiting for a lover 
 the more 
 till i walk out of our our lives 
 home is from you? 
 
 oh girl, you look so fine 
 for i had told you to do 
 
 if you take a car, i'll tax the heat 
 if you take a walk, i'll tax your feet 
 
 taxman! 
 cos i'm the taxman, yeah i'm the taxman 
 
 should five per cent appear too small 
 and then and then i might 
 never be the lonely one 
 
 if i could forget her, but it's my pride 
 yes i get by with a little help from my friends 
 mm gonna try with a little help
