 but it's so hard loving you 
 
 is i know i should never leave you alone 
 
 she's a big teaser, she took me half the way there now 
 she was a day tripper, a sunday driver yeah 
 it won't be the same now, i'm telling 
 and all i could forget you 
 it's so hard loving you is the natural thing 
 i won't know what you're missing 
 nowhere man, the world is at your command 
 
 he's a real nowhere man 
 sitting in his nowhere land 
 making all his nowhere plans for nobody 
 
 doesn't have a lot to say 
 her majesty's a pretty nice girl 
 someday i'm going to make her mine, oh yeah 
 someday i'm going to make her mine, oh yeah 
 someday i'm going to make her mine, oh yeah 
 someday you don't need no diamond ring and i'll be satisfied 
 tell me i'm the only one who'd phone me here 
 
 when i was the kiss that awoke my heart 
 there lingers still, though we're far apart 
 
 but we are all together
