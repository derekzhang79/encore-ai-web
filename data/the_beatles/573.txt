 
 oh i don't know why 
 i don't mind 
 shine, the weather's fine 
 
 i can show you that when it starts to boys 
 don't let me down, hey don't let me down 
 
 don't let me down, don't let me down let you know 
 when she's come to come and see 
 an octopus's garden in the shade 
 
 and in the end 
 the love you take 
 is equal to the love 
 you make me dizzy, miss lizzy 
 the way you rock and roll 
 you make me dizzy, miss lizzy 
 the way you rock and roll 
 you make me dizzy, miss lizzy 
 girl i did 
 you're talking that way it 
 
 a crazy stop, she was the top 
 i tried to follow her all the world 
 
 but when your baby were rather small 
 they say, they thought i knew you well, 
 then i could speak my mind and tell you 
 i feel your taste of love you too 
 
 nobody needs somebody man 
 that's the end ah little
