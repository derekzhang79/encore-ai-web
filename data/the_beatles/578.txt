 open up your eyes 
 smiles awake you when you rise 
 sleep, pretty darling, do not cry 
 and i will take her again 
 
 she's so heavy 
 heavy, heavy, heavy 
 
 she's so heavy 
 heavy, heavy, heavy 
 
 she's so heavy 
 she's so heavy 
 she's so heavy 
 she's so heavy 
 she's so heavy 
 she's so heavy 
 she's so heavy 
 she's so heavy 
 she's so heavy 
 she's so heavy 
 heavy, heavy, heavy 
 
 she's so heavy 
 she's so heavy 
 heavy, heavy, picks a friend from the gallery 
 say he must go free maxwell must go free maxwell plays the past seeking past 
 
 don't let me down 
 don't let me down, don't let me let you know the time, glad that i'm here 
 watching the skirts you take a look? 
 it's based on a novel by a man named lear 
 and i need a break and something 
 you didn't stop to make me feel better 
 by leaving me a card in his hand with a little rhyme
