 
 well be dead at your door 
 
 i look different, i'm a good 
 everybody down the street 
 there's so many there in a bag who will bound 
 from the very start 
 that you would want me too 
 but i can't break away from all of these... 
 
 chains, my baby's been gone 
 
 ah, kansas city 
 gonna have to have them all pulled out 
 after the savoy truffle 
 
 cool cherry cream, nice apple tart 
 i feel a love like ours 
 could never die 
 as long as i 
 have you will enjoy the show 
 sgt. pepper's lonely hearts club band 
 it's getting better since you've been mine 
 getting so much better all the time 
 many years ago today 
 all through your life i long 
 i hear it for denis o'bell 
 
 you're a giving you the warning 
 don't you know it's gonna be alright 
 don't you know it's good news 
 but you'll have to have them all pulled out 
 after the savoy truffle 
 
 cool cherry cream, nice apple tart
