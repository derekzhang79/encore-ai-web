 whole lot of money that's what i want that's what i want that's what i want that's what i want yeah

 well come into my eyes 
 every day i've done nothing but cry 
 
 in penny lane the barber shaves another customer 
 we see now 
 i'll try to make it shine 
 there's nothing i would rather do 
 i've discovered i'm in love with her i'm happy 
 just to know that she loves me 
 yes, she does 
 
 don't you know it's gonna be alright 
 don't you know it's gonna be alright 
 don't you know that it's so 
 there'll be no sad
