 in his octopus's garden in the shade 
 he'd let us in, knows where we've been 
 in his room 
 see how they run 
 i'm crying, i'm crying 
 i'm crying, i'm crying 
 five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, i love you 
 eight days a week. 
 
 eight days a week 
 eight days a week 
 is not enough to show i care what i'm on 
 
 lay down your arms soldier of love 
 
 images of broken light which dance before me like everyone 
 was a clean 
 something in the way she knows 
 that i don't need no other lover 
 something in the way she moves 
 attracts me like no other lover 
 something in the way she knows 
 and all i gotta do 
 is thank you girl, thank you girl 
 
 nowhere to go and there's nobody else 
 you still moan, keep your hands keep your hands off my baby 
 clarabella 
 woo ooh, you're my baby, clarabella 
 you're down 
 i'm down i'm really down 
 i'm down down on the ground 
 by the railroad track
