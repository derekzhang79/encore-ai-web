 it's not the way you had 
 you make me dizzy, miss lizzy 
 the way you rock and roll 
 wanna die yeah wanna die 
 if i ain't dead already 
 i can show you, she'll be bad 
 but i love you still 
 
 hold you in his armchair you can come 
 thursday night your stocking needed mending 
 see all his hair so madam, will good 
 good night, good night, everybody 
 everybody everywhere 
 good night there's nothing i think you know 
 she said so 
 she's in love with you 
 i need never care 
 you know i love you 
 
 let me hear you go 
 
 babe i woke up this morning 
 lucille for you 
 he helps you to understand 
 that love of yours, to miss that love is something i'd hate 
 i'll be on my way 
 
 if you want someone 
 to make or love, sing you can't be like me 
 longer than the honey 
 oh please

 if i needed
