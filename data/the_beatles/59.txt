 
 i love you 
 
 since you need a shoulder to cry on 
 if you know it's true 
 yes it is, yes 
 
 don't you know it's gonna be alright 
 don't you run and hide 
 if you must return it, you might not feel it now 
 but not today 
 the only difference is you're down there 
 and it's my mind 
 and there's no time when i'm alone 
 
 i think about you all the time 
 
 hold me, hold me, hold me out 
 
 when you're near 
 words of love you whisper soft and true 
 darling i love you 
 don't want to stay there 
 
 and she never walk down lime street any more 
 oh the judge he guilty found her for robbing a homeward bounder 
 that dirty no good robbing maggie mae 
 this boy 
 man, this boy 
 this boy wouldn't mind the pain 
 would always feel the same 
 i've got nothing to say but oh my 
 that boy isn't good for you 
 though we may be blind 
 no one i
