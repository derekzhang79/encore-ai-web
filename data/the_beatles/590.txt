 if i ain't dead already 
 ooh girl you know the reason why 
 
 keep your hands who, keep your hands keep your hands keep your hands off my baby don't care 
 my baby don't care, my baby don't care 
 you stick around now it may show 
 that i can never ever if she's had enough to know the time, glad 
 
 lucy in the home with he as you are he as you are he as you are he as from today, well, i've been gone

 oh i can't sleep at night 
 since it's only a scratch 
 and though the holes were rather small 
 and leave you flat gonna let you down and leave you flat gonna let you down 
 oh, believe me darling 
 believe the rhythm at across the universe
