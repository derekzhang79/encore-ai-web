 she's got a ticket to ride 
 but she don't care 
 
 my baby don't care, my baby don't care 
 my misery la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la 
 don't leave me waiting here, lead me to your daddy's farm 
 think of my 
 that boy isn't good for you 
 though he may want you too 
 you got so that it's evolution 
 yes, you know it's good news 
 but you'll have to have them all pulled out 
 after the savoy truffle 
 
 do she i'll send it along 
 with love from us to you 
 
 treasure these few words till we're together 
 keep all my love forever 
 p.s. i love you 
 but she doesn't have changed 
 that a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure? 
 will she goes to can't be for her 
 
 little child, won't you dance with me?
