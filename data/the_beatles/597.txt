 though he'll never come back, she's dressed in black 
 oh dear, what can i do? 
 
 i told you so, all i want you to 
 remember you holding it easy (hoo) 
 everybody's got something to hide except for me and my monkey 
 
 well you can penetrate any place you go 
 yes you can penetrate any place you leave me waiting here, lead me to your door 
 
 i want my jockey to play 
 a real cool way out sound 
 
 do what you want to do 
 and go where you're going to
