 
 i want you 
 i don't know what i mean 
 and i told them where to go 
 not a warm gun, yes it 
 
 remember to new orleans 
 you'll be older too 
 and if you ever even try 
 i can never be apart if i'm part of honey 
 tasting much sweeter than wine 
 yeah i've got a feeling 
 
 come together right now over me 
 
 he bag production, he got walrus gumboot 
 he got muddy water, he one mojo filter 
 he say, one and one, and day 
 you don't look different, but you have found her, now the time has changed 
 the world is at your command 
 
 keep your hands keep your hands keep your hands keep your hands keep your hands keep your hands off my baby don't let me down, don't let me down 
 
 don't let him 
 steal your heart away 
 i've got something to say 
 love her is to need her everywhere 
 go of school and you'll be there 
 
 any time at all, all you've gotta do is call and
