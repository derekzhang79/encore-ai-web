 i look at the floor and i see it needs sweeping 
 still my guitar gently weeps 
 i look at the floor and i see it needs sweeping 
 still my guitar gently weeps 
 i look at the floor and i see it needs sweeping 
 still my guitar gently weeps 
 
 i don't mind if you lend my lips again 
 
 a taste of honey
