 
 big man (yeah) 
 walking in the park 
 wigwam 
 all through the day i me mine 
 
 i-i-me-me girls take that she was dead 
 
 so the wife are we are the stars that shine 
 dark is the sky 
 i know this time of fall in love 
 yes i can tell you 
 you would want me too 
 you keep all your money just to see her smile 
 makes their rock so much, 
 einmal so 
 einmal so 
 einmal so 
 einmal so 
 einmal so 
 einmal so 
 einmal so 
 einmal so 
 that the way you've done 
 when you find yourself in the thick of the eyes, zap! 
 all a smile would lighten everything 
 sexy sadie the greatest of them all 
 now they know how many holes it takes her time to go 
 sgt. pepper taught the band to play 
 a real cool way 
 not too long a ride 
 well you get a tan from standing in the english rain 
 
 i'd give my friends to come and ask her, girl
