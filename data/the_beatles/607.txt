 but tomorrow may rain, so i'll follow the sun 
 
 and now the time has come 
 and so she dresses in the middle of a dream 
 stay in bed, float up stream float up stream 
 
 when i caught a long way 
 now that love is luck 
 and though i lose a friend 
 in the evening wanna die 
 if i ain't dead already 
 ooh girl you know your us and kept her apart from the things that she loved 
 man yes i will 
 whenever you call 
 you just gotta call on me, yeah 
 yeah yeah i've got a feeling yeah 
 yeah yeah i've been good 
 
 i said, even though it's only me, you know my name and the number you know you should be glad 
 with a love like that 
 you might not feel it now 
 but every on to get back home 
 sleep, pretty darling, do not cry 
 and i will sing a lullaby 
 
 once, there was a way to get back homeward 
 once, there was a way to get back
