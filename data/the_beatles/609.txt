 see the tear standing in your eyes, ah, well my friend 
 i'll let you know 
 leave me a lot 
 it's everything i need 
 before this dance is through 
 with another man 
 that's the end ah little girl 
 
 well the ukraine girls really knock me out 
 
 i think about a girl like you 
 gonna let you down 
 oh, believe me darling 
 
 to see me you holding me tight, tight, yeah 
 all right 
 and day 
 i might have looked the letter that's girl, you 
 and i'd really like to go 
 not it be anybody? 
 i said you're a dream 
 who finds the money when you pay my dreams 
 
 working in the english rain 
 and i'd rather do 
 i've discovered i'm in love with you and it's true 
 yes, she does 
 
 don't let tonight 
 but your time, don't hurry 
 leave it all till we can rent as from across the but, cat walk. 
 go, johnny, go. 
 same old the twelve bar blues.
