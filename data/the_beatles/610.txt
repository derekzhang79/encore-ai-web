 
 here, some other guy, is makin' me very very mad, oh now 
 some other guy now, has taken my love away from me, oh now 
 some other guy now, has taken my love away from me, oh now 
 some other guy now, is sippin' up the honey like a yellow dog, oh oh 
 
 because you're sweet and i too play guitar, sometimes i play the fool... 
 you get a tan from standing in the english rain 
 that boy isn't good for you 
 though he never seems to notice 
 
 i don't know why 
 i cry for you 
 
 i've been waiting here for you 
 wond'ring what you're gonna do 
 should i love you more than ever girl i do 
 leave you flat gonna let you down 
 oh, believe me darling 
 
 when you sigh, my, my inside 
 i'll write home every day 
 
 i can show you that when it starts to play 
 
 we didn't run for the world going for through the old time 
 
 give it to all his head 
 see the world spinning
