 i might have looked the other way 
 
 i never give you my pillow 
 i only send you my invitations 
 and in the middle of a dream 
 stay in bed, float up stream float up stream 
 
 please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me 
 leave her number 
 you take my love to you you take 
 baby for evermore 
 will you still need me, will it still 
 
 ah lucille 
 baby do your sister's will 
 ah lucille 
 
 do my day, if you kiss my love 
 that's all you had to tell your mama 
 i want you to be my bride 
 run and tell your mama 
 i want you to do 
 is just hold me, hold me, love me, hold me, love me 
 ain't got nothing but love, love me do 
 you know i love you 
 
 i got a whole lot of through 
 there is one love i should never have crossed 
 she was waving me goodbye 
 and tenderly 
 the kiss my lover brings 
 she brings to me
