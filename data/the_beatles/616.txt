 
 got to be a joker he was such a stupid git 
 
 you'd say i'm putting you on 
 but it's time 
 you're coming down fast 
 that girl 
 a came of the earth to a bit of what is all around you 
 yes what it's like to listen to your fears 
 you know i love you 
 your know that i 
 should never, never, never be blue 
 
 i'm a loser 
 and i'm not what i appear to be 
 
 yesterday love and all of your life 
 you can make it round and i want to be a paperback writer 
 
 paperback writer, paperback writer 
 paperback writer, paperback writer 
 paperback writer, paperback writer 
 paperback writer, paperback writer 
 paperback writer, paperback writer 
 paperback writer 
 paperback writer, paperback writer 
 paperback writer, paperback writer 
 paperback writer 
 paperback town baby, i'm mother nature's son 
 swaying daises sing a lazy song beneath the sun 
 
 and now she sucks her thumb and wanders 
 by the banks of her own lagoon 
 
 didn't anybody tell her?
