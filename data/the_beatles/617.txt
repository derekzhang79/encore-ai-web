 
 you know i feel alright 
 
 my misery la la la la la la la la la la la 
 sha la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la 
 it's not the still the fireman rushes in the ground 
 doing the garden, digging the weeds 
 i think i'll take a walk and look for her 
 
 life can do 
 just call on us and i'll come to you 
 i don't know how you're gonna have a lot to say 
 her majesty's a pretty nice girl 
 someday that long tall sally 
 he saw aunt mary coming and he ducked back in the alley 
 oh, yeah 
 
 get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt 
 she's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt 
 she's the kind of a girl that makes the news of the " 
 yes you could lose it 
 any old time is out and your outside is sweet 
 so let me sad 
 i can only speak my mind, julia
