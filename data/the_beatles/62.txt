 you gotta wait a minute, wait a minute 
 you gotta wait a minute, wait a minute 
 you gotta wait a minute, wait a minute 
 you gotta wait a minute, wait a minute 
 you gotta check it and see, one more time 
 who, baby today 
 
 they don't believe what i thought tonight 
 for red is the color that will make me blue 
 cause you know darling i love only you 
 you'll never do you no harm 
 believe me darling 
 
 it doesn't really matter what they say, 
 i know i'm gonna have a lot to say 
 her majesty's a pretty nice girl 
 but she changes from day to day 
 
 i want to be a paperback writer
