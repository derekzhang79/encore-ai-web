 bompa bom chop the tree 
 bompa bom skip the rope 
 bompa bom look at me 
 and all the time 
 what do you see that i ever done 
 cos you dance to me 
 
 well i gave you everything i had 
 and your bird can swing 
 but i need a break and i want to be a paperback and your man

 beep beep'm beep beep yeah 
 beep beep'm beep beep yeah 
 beep beep'm beep beep yeah 
 beep beep'm beep beep yeah fade out 
 after the savoy truffle 
 
 her baby buys her things, you know 
 she said so 
 i'm in love with her and i feel it now i go 
 but someone to love 
 someone like you 
 
 as the june light turns to moonlight
