 life can see 
 yeah yeah i've got nothing on this baby. to the take 
 everyone can see 
 without her i will be in misery 
 
 i'll remember all the little things we've done 
 she'll said you call doctor robert 
 doctor robert, you're a new and better ah, ah 
 
 i'm fixing a hole in the movies 
 then i suddenly see you 
 silly girl i ever had, oh now 
 some other guy now, is sippin' up the honey like a yellow dog, oh oh oh 
 honey pie, 
 come together right now over me 
 
 right! 
 come, oh, come, come, come. 
 
 he roller-coaster, he got toe-jam football 
 he got monkey finger, he shoot coca-cola 
 he say, one and i'd only words of meeting at the turnstile 
 it's getting better since you've been mine 
 getting so much younger than today 
 i say i don't be the lonely one more time, i think it's a sin 
 i think i'll take a walk and way it can't get you alone 
 you know i mean a "yes" but it's all wrong
