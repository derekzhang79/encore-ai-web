 i've been away now 
 oh how, i've been in love before 
 
 it's been a long long long time 
 since i heard from that girl of mine 
 getting nowhere 
 on our way back home 
 we're on our way home 
 we're going home

 waiting for your knock, dear 
 on my old front door

 that if somebody tries to take my place 
 let's pretend we said will a second time 
 not the second time

 when i get near you 
 the games begin to drag me down
