 
 found my coat and grabbed my hat 
 made the bus in seconds flat 
 found my way 
 you're going to find her gone 
 just call on us and we'll send it along 
 with love from us to you 
 
 close your eyes and i'll close mine 
 good night, sleep tight 
 now the moon begins to shine 
 good night, sleep tight 
 dream sweet dreams for me dream sweet 
 dream sweet dreams for you 
 
 but close to hear you're gone 
 
 lucy in the sky with diamonds 
 lucy in the sky with diamonds 
 lucy in the sky with diamonds 
 lucy in the sky with diamonds 
 lucy in the sky with diamonds 
 lucy in the sky with diamonds 
 lucy in the sky with diamonds 
 lucy in the sky with diamonds 
 aaaaahhhhh... 
 
 follow her 
 yes you can imitate everyone you know 
 she said so 
 i'm in love with you 
 and all i gotta do 
 is thank you girl, thank you girl 
 
 thank you, uh, ha ha ha!
