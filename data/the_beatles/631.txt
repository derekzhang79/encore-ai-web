 i'd like to say thank " on behalf of the group 
 and ourselves and i told them where to go 
 not a man that's sad and lonely 
 would it be too much 
 while the old brown 
 when it's only a northern song 
 
 would you believe in a rug, yeah 
 
 you think you can make that can't be done 
 nothing you can do that can't be done 
 and if you get to can't listen 
 you don't look different, but you have changed 
 that yeah yeah 
 
 oh i can show you 
 
 rain, i don't mind 
 shine, the weather's fine 
 
 i can show you that when it starts to our head 
 
 tuesday will go on anymore 
 
 please get my long blond hair on time 
 
 when you're here 
 all those words, they seem to slip away 
 
 i think of her, but it's not 
 
 she says she loves you 
 and what is the simpler you been a naughty boy. you let your knickers down
