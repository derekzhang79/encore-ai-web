 yes it is, it's true 
 yes it is, yes it is 
 with us to take, it's all within yourself 
 no one else can make you change 
 
 ob-la-di ob-la-da life goes on, on my knees 
 begging if you do 
 
 anna 
 now my advice for those who die 
 declare the pennies on your eyes 
 cos i'm the taxman, yeah i'm the taxman 
 
 and till the day i will 
 
 and when the night is hang my loving i know i mean a "yes" but it's all wrong 
 fun tonight 
 she's mine keep your hands off my baby 
 you better watch yourself now 
 boy, you get it through your head 
 what's your name 
 well you went up and married 
 but i don't know why 
 i don't mind 
 shine, the weather's fine 
 
 baby 
 
 i think about you night and all i'm think that i'm free 
 show me what you see 
 she he just had a dream 
 everybody pulled their socks up 
 everybody put their foot down
