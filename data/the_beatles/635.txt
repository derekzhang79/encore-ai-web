 
 well you know i find you 
 you'll never know it hurt me so 
 so forget the other boys they had a jamboree 
 they're filled with tears 
 and since i lost you 
 remember i'll always be true 
 yes, it seems so long 
 girl, since you've been gone 
 and you're gone 
 are you going to be with another man 
 that's the end ah little girl 
 nah nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah, nah nah nah, nah nah nah, nah nah nah, hey jude 
 nah nah nah 
 ow! 
 
 we're sgt. pepper's lonely hearts club band 
 we hope you have enjoyed the show 
 sgt. pepper's lonely hearts club band 
 it's getting better since you've been mine 
 getting so much better all the time 
 
 crying, do do do do, it seems so useless i know it's wrong 
 keep a crying, waiting, hoping you'll come back 
 you're gonna change my world 
 
 images of broken light which shines rocky comes 
 now i'm coming back home 
 i've been away
