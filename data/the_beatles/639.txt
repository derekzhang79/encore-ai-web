 nobody can deny that there's something there 
 
 there, running my hands through her shoulder 
 made her lonely 
 
 now you went down 
 come and keep your comrade warm 
 i'm back in the u.s.s.r. 
 you don't know how lucky you are boy 
 down 
 you may think the chords are going 
 they're going to crucify me 
 
 bright are not the many ways of love 
 
 you'd all love to see the plan 
 you may be awoken, i'll be 'round, i'll be 'round 
 
 help me get my feet back on the ground 
 won't you please, please help me 
 
 i don't know how someone controlled you 
 they bought and sold you 
 
 i go of you 
 i may be sad if our new love was in vain 
 
 so i hope we passed the audition! 
 
 when you look i'm really down 
 oh baby i'm down yea 
 baby i'm down i'm really down 
 oh baby i'm down yea 
 oh baby i'm down i'm really down 
 
 i'm in love with you
