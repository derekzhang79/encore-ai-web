 listen to me 
 fixing a hole where the rain gets in 
 stops my mind from wandering 
 where it will go oh 
 
 ah girl, girl, girl 
 
 let me take you down, cause i'm going to make her mine, oh yeah 
 
 you're giving me the same old line 
 i'm wondering why 
 you hurt me then 
 you're mine please 
 come on come on come on let's take it easy 
 so he waits behind 
 writing 50 times i must hear it say 
 but it's a man that's sad and lonely 
 and i held her hand in mine... 
 
 she's got the lonely wanna die 
 if i ain't dead already 
 ooh like i love you 
 
 i love you, honey pie you are driving me frantic 
 sail across the shoulder 
 i'll be writing more in a week or two 
 but happy in the end 
 yes i will, i'll get you in the end 
 oh yeah 
 oh yeah love is all you need 
 love is all you need 
 love is all you need 
 love
