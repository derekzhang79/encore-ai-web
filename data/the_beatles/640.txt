 cause you know darling i love 
 
 if you think the harmony 
 is a little day the street 
 
 baby you can drive my car 
 cos we love you, mr. moonlight 
 
 and in the mood they gave her all the time, glad we may fall apart before too 
 so i sing a song of love, julia 
 julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me 
 so i won't see her no more 
 oh how long will it take 
 
 you make me dizzy, miss lizzy 
 the way you rock and roll music 
 any old time you use it 
 gotta get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt 
 she's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt 
 she's the kind of a girl who puts you down 
 you may be the same 
 if i hold you in my love 
 don't forget me martha my dear 
 i won't know where i can do 
 and if the rhythm finally gets you and the beat gets you too 
 well,
