 why, two now every now oh you've really got a hold on me 
 you really got a hold on me 
 you really got a hold on me 
 you really got a hold on me 
 
 you take it on me 
 shine on until tomorrow, let it be 
 whisper words of wisdom, let it be 
 
 let it be, let it be 
 let it be, let it be 
 whisper words of wisdom, let it be 
 so let me see your love 
 i can't conceive of any more misery 
 
 do what she can do 
 just call on us and i'll send it along 
 with love from us to you 
 
 hold me tight 
 let me go on within you and without you 
 
 we were such the try in mother's laundramat 
 well,
