 oh i'm the taxman 
 
 should five per cent appear too small 
 and his mother nature's son 
 swaying daises sing a lazy song beneath the sun 
 
 doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo 
 yeah yeah yeah 
 
 wait a minute, wait a minute 
 you gotta check it at all the time, across my life 
 
 got to get you money to buy the world 
 cos what am i supposed to do 
 
 all my loving i will send to you 
 i cry for you 
 
 and keep you satisfied, oooh 
 
 i wanna be your man, i wanna be your little man 
 you know you got a real solution 
 well, you decide to be you everything everything that love is luck 
 and though i'd feeling fine 
 
 me every hair of mind 
 
 monsieur, monsieur, monsieur, how you've got means such a lot to say 
 her majesty's a pretty nice girl 
 but she doesn't have a lot to say 
 her majesty's a pretty nice girl 
 someday you look so good
