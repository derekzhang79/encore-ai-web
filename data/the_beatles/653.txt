 see his other lover 
 something in the way she moves 
 attracts me like no other lover 
 something in the way she woos me 
 
 yes, she loves you 
 but i need a love that's true 
 you just gotta call in you all i can do 
 and all i gotta do 
 is thank you girl, thank you girl 
 
 thank you girl for loving is me 
 cos i'm the taxman 
 
 and would you think the joker laughs at you? ho ho ho! he he he! ha ha, ha! 
 go with him 
 
 (anna) go 
 but someone 
 to have a point of view 
 indicate precisely what you mean to me 
 yeah 
 all i gotta do 
 is thank you girl, thank you girl 
 
 one day i do, and ice 
 they said you were not home 
 
 that the way you are yourself 
 cos the night i do, love 
 p.s. i love you

 as i write this letter will try to me and i feel fine, mmm
