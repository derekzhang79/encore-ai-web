 waiting to keep her back in the u.s.s.r. 
 you don't know what you're missing 
 
 i'd ask you to be my bride 
 in the evening will never die 
 and i love her 
 and i do and i do 
 and i will take her heart 
 no she's an angel sent to me 
 tell me wanna die 
 if i ain't dead already 
 ooh ooh 
 my baby don't care, my baby don't care what goes on around 
 in their eyes they start to stare 
 i'm gonna hide myself away, ay hay 
 i ain't got to admit it's getting better since you've been mine 
 getting so much better all the time 
 
 crying, do do do do, it seems so useless i stop i'm feeling blue 
 tell me, oh what can i do? 
 baby's in black and they called it me and 
 and i told them where to go 
 not when it rains and shines 
 can you hear me, that when it rains and shines 
 when it rains and shines 
 it's not because i'm sad not better 
 
 you
