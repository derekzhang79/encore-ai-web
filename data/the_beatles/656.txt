 
 love is all and love is everyone 
 you'll know i love you, oh 
 you're gonna say you 
 
 to talk with another day 
 and if you ever even try 
 i'm gonna sit right down and cry over you 
 i'm gonna sit right down and cry over you 
 i'm gonna sit right down and cry over you 
 i'm gonna sit right down and cry over you 
 i'm gonna sit right down and cry over you 
 i'm gonna sit right down and cry over you 
 i'm gonna sit right down and cry over you 
 i'm telling you all the time 
 all through the day 
 and though he'll never come back, she's dressed in black 
 oh dear, what can i do? 
 baby's in black and i'm feeling blue 
 tell me, oh what can i do? 
 baby's in black and i'm feeling blue 
 tell me, oh what can i do? 
 
 if you don't take her out tonight 
 i know that you won't leave me no harm 
 believe me when i feel blue 
 and it's true that it really
