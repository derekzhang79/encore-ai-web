 
 hey, hey, hey, and i do 
 
 and i will take her out tonight 
 and i will say but i, i could get her back again 
 because i know my number three you know my number four 
 oh you did the time, glad 
 
 i'd really sympathize 
 don't you love me do 
 that she don't care 
 there's no fun in what i do if she's gone i can't go on 
 holding back these eyes now, for the final number, john's got a card in his hand with her 
 she wouldn't say. 
 i said something 
 how could she treat us so thoughtlessly? 
 how could she do this just to hear you say goodbye and i say hello 
 hello hello hello hello 
 hello goodbye hello goodbye hello hello 
 hello hello 
 hello hello 
 hello hello 
 hello goodbye hello hello 
 hello goodbye hello hello 
 hello goodbye hello goodbye hello hello 
 hello hello hello goodbye hello hello 
 hello hello 
 hello goodbye hello hello goodbye hello hello hello hello 
 hello goodbye hello hello 
 i'd touch my name
