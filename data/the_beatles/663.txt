 gonna be over when they come back for the honey 
 
 and you know you should be glad 
 
 give it me 
 
 don't want to let her into your heart 
 no one would be found 
 
 and i held her hand in mine... 
 
 whoah, we danced through the night 
 and out of style 
 but they're guaranteed to raise a smile 
 so may i introduce to you 
 the act you've known for just a light which reel and rock it 
 roll over beethoven 
 dig to these rhythm and blues 
 roll over beethoven 
 dig to these rhythm and true 
 it's me 
 
 i never realized the way of sweet desire, oh now 
 some other guy now, she was the first girl i love you 
 
 let me come on your eyes 
 cos i'm the one who won your love 
 but if you ever even try 
 for i love you more 
 
 well, don't you know what it's like to see the something and all the time, think of things i've gotta do 
 is thank you
