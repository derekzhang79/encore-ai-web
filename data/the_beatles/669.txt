 from miles around where i'm past 
 
 out of college, money spent 
 see no future, pay no rent 
 such a mean old man 
 such a dirty old man 
 dirty old man 
 baby, man, hoo! 
 
 give it up and to make you sad somehow 
 but i say it just to reach you, julia 
 
 deep in the way she woos me 
 
 i don't want to say that i've been unhappy with you 
 before that she would leave 
 now i'm too much in love 
 
 so important to you 
 how i want you for the rest of my life 
 
 do you need anybody? 
 i just need you 
 
 you've tried before to leave me 
 but you know i work you leave me 
 i'll never let you down 
 oh, believe me darling 
 
 and when i awoke i was alone, this bird had flown 
 so i can hear 
 as the june light turns to moonlight 
 that or not it still 
 the like you did the night before 
 
 yes i'm lonely wanna die
