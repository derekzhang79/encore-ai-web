 cause you know darling i love only you 
 
 and keep you by my side 
 if i could forget her, but it's my pride 
 yes i'm down 
 oh so bad 
 all i gotta do is act naturally 
 
 well, i'll bet you i'm gonna be a time 
 when i'm gonna change/make your mind 
 so keep their lemonade 
 when the sun shines 
 
 rain, so hold me tight 
 let me go on loving you 
 tonight, tonight 
 it's you, you you you oooo oooo 
 
 don't know what you're missing 
 nowhere man, the world is at your command 
 
 don't you worry about a thing if you start to dance and sing 
 and chills coming up on the ground 
 won't you please, please help me 
 leave me in drag dressed in her polythene bag 
 yes you will, you won't 
 the words you long to hear 
 i'm in love but i'm lazy 
 so won't you please come on, come on, come on... 
 
 come on, come on, come on
