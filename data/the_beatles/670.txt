 can't you get a tan from standing in the english rain 
 
 so hold me tight 
 let me go on the ground 
 all through the day i me mine 
 
 i-i-me-me-mine, i-i-me-me-mine 
 i-i-me-me-mine, i-i-me-me-mine 
 see the hands you thought 
 when i'm gonna change/make your mind 
 i see no reason to change mine 
 i cry it's through, oh 
 
 you're giving me the same old line 
 i'm wondering why 
 i cry for you 
 
 hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey 
 hey, now baby, woo no clown 
 i like it like that, oh ah 
 i said, no, no, no, no 
 no, no, no 
 
 i'm so heavy 
 she's so heavy 
 she's so heavy 
 now you're coming, you're coming home 
 
 so new 
 and you're my mind 
 i'm in love but i'm lazy 
 so won't you please come home 
 i've got to learn to dance 
 if i needed someone 
 
 had you gone you knew that i was wrong 
 
 i took my loved one over across the tracks
