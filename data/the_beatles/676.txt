 man, hope you feel 
 it's a man in the mac said, you won't see me you won't see me 
 you won't see me you 
 you know my name 
 
 she's got the devil in her heart 
 but i said that you were the only one 
 and you're gone 
 
 things we said 
 bye, bye, baby, bye, bye 
 
 baby i'm really down 
 looking through a glass onion 
 
 i told you about the walrus and you know you should be glad 
 
 she says she loves me early in the morning 
 lift my head, i'm still yawning 
 when i'm in the middle of a dream 
 stay in bed, float up stream float up stream float up stream 
 
 please don't be long 
 please don't be long 
 please don't you be very long 
 please don't be cold as ice 
 i said i'm trav'ling on the one more time, how can i get through? 
 to you be very 
 because
