 and all the fun we had 
 we can work it out and get it my way 
 i'd do all right 
 have some fun tonight 
 everything's all right 
 see me die 
 tonight, tonight 
 
 she's so heavy 
 she's so heavy 
 she's so heavy 
 she's so heavy 
 heavy, heavy, heavy 
 she's so heavy 
 heavy, heavy, picks my eye 
 she hates to rain 
 when the rain comes they go to heaven 
 one two three four five six seven 
 all good children go to heaven 
 one two three four five six seven 
 all good children go to heaven 
 one two three four five six seven 
 all good children go to heaven 
 one two three four five six seven 
 all good children go to heaven 
 one two three four five six seven 
 all good children go to heaven 
 one two three four five six seven 
 all good children go to heaven 
 one two three four five six seven 
 all good children go to heaven 
 one two three four five
