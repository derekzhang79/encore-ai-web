 i never weep at home 
 i'll be on my way oh 
 i'll be on my way 
 
 just one more thing, girl 
 you give back your hand 
 oh how they run 
 i'm crying, i'm crying 
 i'm crying, i'm crying 
 
 lady madonna, baby at your breast 
 wonders how the goes of dakota 
 there at the turnstile 
 it's been a long cold lonely winter 
 found my way 
 you're going to lose that girl 
 if you can do that oh should 
 but if the rhythm finally gets you and the beat gets you too 
 well, here's something for you to do 
 
 i got a whole lot of things to tell her 
 oh how long will it take 
 
 whoa, oh, these chains of love got a hold from my friends 
 mm and she's dead of my life 
 
 got to get you in my broken chair, my baby's so hard to find 
 and i held her hand in mine... 
 
 whoah, we danced through the night 
 and your bird can swing 
 but
