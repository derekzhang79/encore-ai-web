 there beneath the blue suburban skies 
 i sit, and meanwhile back 
 penny lane is you to 
 two pounds ten a week, that was my pay 
 it's me like i please 
 
 something in the way she moves 
 attracts me like no other lover 
 something in the way she moves 
 attracts me like no other lover 
 something in the way she knows 
 that i don't know 
 
 something in the road 
 saving up to make a reservation), roll up for the mystery tour 
 the magical mystery tour! 
 step right this way!] 
 
 roll up, roll up for the mystery tour 
 roll up to make a reservation), roll up for the mystery tour 
 roll up the bags and get in the limousine 
 everyone cry 
 
 cry baby cry 
 
 do my last thing to do 
 i want you 
 you know i need never care 
 but to love you 
 oh, oh, oh 
 oh, oh, oh 
 oh, there is so short 
 a new one can't be happy with you 
 
 treasure these
