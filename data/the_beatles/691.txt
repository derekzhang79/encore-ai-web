 it's getting hard to be 
 
 lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void 
 it is shining, it is shining 
 
 to hear you play your music 
 you know my name 
 baby you-a you know you should 
 know what to do 
 and i held her hand in mine... 
 
 whoah, we danced through the night 
 and your bird can swing 
 but you can't hear me, you can't see me 
 
 i want that love of yours, to miss that love is something you can't reject 
 i'm going to make her mine, oh yeah 
 someday i'm going to make her mine, oh yeah 
 someday i'm going to make her mine, oh yeah 
 someday i'm going to make her mine, oh boy 
 four thousand holes in blackburn, lancashire 
 and though the moon begins to shine 
 good night, sleep tight 
 dream sweet dreams for me dream sweet 
 dream sweet dreams for me dream sweet 
 dream sweet dreams for you 
 
 we might as well 
 i want you 
 i want you 
 i want you so bad
