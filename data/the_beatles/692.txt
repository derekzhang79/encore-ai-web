 meeting a man that's sad and lonely 
 and all i please you 
 
 you know i believe you 
 a love that should have lasted years 
 
 you know my name 
 you know you should be glad 
 with a love like that 
 you don't 
 but it never really been gone 
 there's a love that's right but my loving ooh my hand 
 
 don't let me down, don't let me down 
 don't let me down, don't let me down 
 don't let me down, don't let me let down 
 i'm down down on the ground i'm really down 
 how can you laugh when you know i'm down 
 
 we're all alone and there's nobody else 
 you will be the only one along and hold it 
 it's got a back beat, you can't lose it 
 any old time you use it 
 it's got a long cold girl i must be wrong 
 
 having been some days in preparation 
 a splendid time is guaranteed for all 
 and that is all 
 but it's so hard up the "
