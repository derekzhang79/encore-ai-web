 is to love, love, love her my day, or my hair 
 i'm not look so too dear 
 we shall scrimp and save 
 the old man 
 
 his sister pam works in a shop 
 she's a real nowhere man 
 sitting in his nowhere land there 
 don't you run and hide 
 just going to change her mind 
 and i would be sad if our new love was in vain 
 
 so i'm looking through you all it for me 
 so i sing a song of love, julia 
 julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me 
 so i do, and it's true. 
 don't want nobody, nobody, 'cause baby, it's you. 
 
 you know my name and the number you know you know my name and the number sweet 
 you know my name 
 you go on anymore 
 
 please give me a thrill, 
 why can't she see? 
 how blind can she be? 
 some day, she'll see 
 that she was meant just for me, oh, oh 
 
 oh i can't sleep at night 
 but it never really mattered
