 ah lucille 
 woo morning

 nothing to do it's true. 
 don't you know the world 
 but the fool on the hill 
 the long time 
 these days such a kind girl 
 seems so hard to find gideon's bible 
 gideon checked out that door 
 again 
 
 come on, come on, come on, come on... 
 
 come on, come on 
 come on, come on, come on 
 so come on, come on, come on 
 
 little child, little child 
 little child, won't you dance with me? 
 i'm so sad and lonely 
 baby take a chance with me 
 baby take a chance with me 
 come down by my side
