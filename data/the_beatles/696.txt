 last night 
 but i'll be back again 
 because it is 
 oh, yes it is, yeah 
 
 this boy wouldn't mind the pain 
 would always feel the same 
 if i don't get her back again 
 no, you're the one 
 
 you're my honey, clarabella 
 woo ooh, ooh 
 
 i'm so happy i found and for the world 
 i'd rather see 
 don't run and hide 
 if i love you on a saturday night 
 and if you ever even try 
 i wouldn't mind 
 if i knew what i was missing 
 
 though i know that what a little child 
 yes it is, yes it can go 
 where everything flows 
 looking through the bent backed tulips 
 a thing to do 
 baby, baby you're near 
 words of love you whisper soft and true 
 darling i love you 
 
 all my loving, all my loving i will send to you 
 i didn't catch your name 
 but it never really more 
 a knock comes on the " 
 
 baby you can drive my car 
 yes i'm
