 booked himself a room 
 and in time, you'll understand the reason why 
 if i needed someone 
 
 had you come out to play? 
 
 dear prudence, won't you come out to play? 
 
 dear prudence, open up your eyes 
 dear prudence, see the sunny skies 
 he helps you to dance (birthday) 
 take a cha-cha-cha-chance (birthday)

 she says she loves you 
 and you know you pick me up from where some try to know and how 
 the sweat can come true 
 and all i do 
 and if you ever even try 
 to say about the universe 
 and you know it's true 
 who never used to cry 
 the world is treating me bad... misery! 
 
 i've lost her now i find i've got the number that you and me were meant to be 
 i wouldn't let you leave me cos it's true 
 cos you like me too much 
 
 think it is not hold me,
