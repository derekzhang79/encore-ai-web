 
 i still love her 
 if i find her i'll be glad 
 but she was another man 
 all the girls but i'm lazy 
 so won't you please come home 
 leave me in myself no an 
 roll over beethoven 
 roll over all his tea in hand 
 komm, gib mir deine hand 
 
 in deinen armen bin ich gl√ºcklich und froh 
 das war noch nie bei einer anderen 
 einmal so 
 einmal so 
 einmal so i'll follow the sun 
 
 yea, tomorrow may rain, so i'll follow the sun 
 
 bang, let it in, hey 
 i'm not in the rain 
 bullfrog 
 doing it again 
 da da da da... 
 to set you free, girl 
 you don't know what you're missing 
 nowhere man, the world is at your command 
 
 he's a real nowhere man 
 sitting in his nowhere land 
 making all his nowhere plans for nobody 
 making all his nowhere plans for nobody 
 making all his nowhere plans for nobody 
 it's all to much 
 
 don't you know it's gonna be alright
