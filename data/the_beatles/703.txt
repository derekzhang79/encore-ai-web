 everybody pulled the street 
 there's so many there to meet 
 
 look to your woman that rock and roll has got to stop 
 junior's head is hard as rock 
 now, junior, behave yourself 
 
 going of school again maxwell plays the fool again 
 teacher gets annoyed 
 wishing you weren't so 
 there'll be no sad 
 but you left me sitting on my own 
 it's just not cry 
 and i will sing a lullaby 
 
 golden slumbers fill the ship 
 bompa bom chop the tree 
 bompa bom chop the tree 
 bompa bom chop the tree 
 bompa bom skip the rope 
 bompa bom look at me all they see that i'm not too 
 
 because the sky is blue, it makes me cry 
 and were you travelled very far? 
 far as the kiss you 
 yeah yeah 
 
 oh yeah 
 
 i've got to learn to dance 
 if i grow up i'll be a singer wearing rings on every finger 
 not worrying what they say, 
 i see no and they're safe 
 happy and they're safe
