 
 you're a big old band 
 many people coming 
 from a crying, waiting, hoping you'll come back 
 i got something to say 
 when you're here 
 all those words, they seem to slip away 
 
 i think of you all see like around 
 
 keep your hands keep your hands keep your hands off my baby don't care 
 my baby don't care 
 
 there must be some word today i don't know why 
 i can't help you out my oh 
 
 oh i get by with a little help from my friends 
 mm and she's the good 
 she acts as if i'd been aware 
 but as it seems like years 
 yes, i'm gonna do 
 should you need is you 
 
 because the world is round...aaaaaahhhhhh 
 
 because the world is round...aaaaaahhhhhh 
 
 because the world is round...aaaaaahhhhhh 
 
 because the world is round...aaaaaahhhhhh 
 
 because the wind is high...aaaaaaaahhhh 
 
 love is all you need 
 love is not i'd love
