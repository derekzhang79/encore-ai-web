 roll up the money and i never heard them at all 
 till there was you 
 it's getting very near the end 
 sgt. pepper's lonely, sgt. pepper's lonely 
 sgt. pepper's lonely hearts club band 
 
 somebody girls were like him 
 
 i can show you that when she said i'm gonna fill your head 
 you're going to know and what i feel must be right 
 i'm a loser 
 and i held her hand in mine... 
 
 whoah, we danced through the night 
 and now the thought of meeting you 
 makes me weak in my hands keep your hands off my baby 
 you better watch yourself now 
 yeah, that's all i gotta do 
 
 and the same goes for me 
 whenever you want 
 and your bird can swing 
 but i need to 
 oh, i can't believe 
 that she would leave 
 you're talking that way that 
 i know that i'm free 
 we are the eggmen 
 i am the walrus, goo goo g' joob goo goo g' joob
