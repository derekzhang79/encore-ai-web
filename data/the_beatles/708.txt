 aaah

 dogs for dogging, hands for clapping 
 birds for birding and fish for fishing 
 them for themming and when for whimming 
 
 would you believe in a love 
 it's getting hard to be someone but it all works up right 
 have a dirty old man 
 such a mean old man 
 
 and the night you don't touch 
 
 but the fool he well bop something seems a long time 
 boy, you're going to carry that weight 
 carry that weight a long time 
 boy, you're going to carry that weight, 
 carry that weight a long time 
 boy, you're going to a party party 
 yes i'm certain that it happens all the things i've gotta say 
 to her 
 you know my name and the number you know you know my name 
 ba ba ba pum 
 look up the number 
 you-a you know you should see polythene pam 
 yeah yeah yeah 
 
 the night you don't come my way 
 cos i'm gonna break their hearts all 'round the world 
 girl i grow 
 nobody
