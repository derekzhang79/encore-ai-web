 takes it out to you, it's so hard to reason 
 with love from us to you 
 
 nowhere man, don't worry 
 to let her under your skin 
 then you find that i don't take what i don't do i've to know? 
 you don't look different, but you can learn when i try to make you sad somehow 
 but i still had a from from the eyes 
 and there's no time when i'm alone 
 
 i'm so glad that she's my little 
 that girl is mine 
 
 keep your hands keep your hands keep your hands off my baby on my wall 
 and maybe you won't be bothered 
 she hates to see 
 the love that's shining all around you 
 silly girl 
 
 martha my dear you have always been my inspiration 
 please 
 remember to let her into your heart 
 not not enough to show i care 
 
 ooh, i need your love, babe 
 just like i need you 
 love you all the time 
 
 hold me, hold me, hold me, hold
