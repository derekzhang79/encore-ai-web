 and if i could see you now 
 i'd try to make you sad somehow 
 but i never heard it at all 
 till there was you 
 it's everything i need 
 before this dance is through these years please 
 
 my girl you start up early in the morning 
 lift my head, i'm still yawning 
 when i'm in the middle of a dream 
 stay in bed, float up stream float up stream 
 
 please don't be long 
 please don't you be very when you treat me so unkind 
 what goes on in your heart? 
 what goes on in your heart? 
 what can i do. 
 can't stop thinking about her i'm loving i knew you would 
 
 nobody ever have built 
 a thought i knew you, what did you see when you rise 
 sleep, pretty darling, do not cry 
 and i will take her out tonight 
 and if i could take it 
 i don't wanna sound complaining 
 but you ain't everything or that i miss her 
 and she never walk down lime street any more 
 good night, good
