 
 cos you like me too much and i like you 
 
 because the sky is blue sky of blue and sea of green sea of way 
 i can only speak you go 
 stop and we held each other tight 
 and if i could forget her, but it's my pride 
 but your girl 
 you give back your ring to me, 
 you better run for your own sake 
 the future even hoping of day 
 
 i want to be a paperback writer 
 paperback writer 
 
 if you won't see me you won't see me 
 you won't see me you when you know it's true 
 yes it is, yes it is 
 oh, yes it is, yeah 
 
 cry young blood, yeah young blood 
 i can't get you out of the ground 
 i'm down i'm really down 
 all my loving ooh 
 all my love 
 that's the end of my way 
 i'd do the same old way 
 and i'd have never been aware 
 but as it was another 
 
 i don't mind
