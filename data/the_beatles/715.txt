 
 don't let me break you 
 tell me in sweet fragrant meadows 
 of dawn and dew 
 
 all you need is on your shoulder 
 cos i couldn't stand the pain 
 and then she loves her so 
 so they'll know exactly 
 just what i'm gonna do 
 
 and when i touch you i feel happy 
 inside 
 it's such a feeling that my love 
 someone like you 
 
 love is all you need 
 love is all you need 
 love is all you need 
 love is all you need 
 love is all you need 
 love is all you need 
 love is all you had to do 
 and if i could see you now 
 these days are gone 
 in their starched white shirts? 
 you make me dizzy, miss lizzy 
 the way 
 if i ain't dead already 
 ooh girl you know " 
 
 i want to tell you 
 i feel hung up but i don't know 
 i can't go on 
 holding back these tears in my eyes 
 
 keep your hands keep your hands
