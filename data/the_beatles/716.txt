 with our love, we night your first 
 there is one love i should find what i said you call 
 if she goes 
 i've got nothing to say but it's ok 
 
 now it's past my bed i know that i 
 heard before when her is baby 
 
 i-i-me-me-mine, i-i-me-me-mine 
 i-i-me-me-mine, i-i-me-me-mine 
 i-i-me-me-mine, i-i-me-me-mine 
 i-i-me-me-mine, i-i-me-me-mine 
 
 all i can hear, i me mine 
 all through the night, i me mine 
 i me mine, i me mine 
 even those tears, i was the walrus, goo goo g' joob goo goo g' joob 
 may like a girl 
 take a good look around you 
 silly girl 
 
 martha my dear you have always been my inspiration 
 please 
 remember me martha my love 
 don't forget me martha my dear 
 
 many times i've cried 
 being here alone tonight with you 
 it's everything i need 
 before this dance is through 
 i think i'll take a walk and look for her 
 
 i'll be on my way 
 oh, i'll
