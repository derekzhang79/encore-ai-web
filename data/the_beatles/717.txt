 she's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt 
 she's the kind of a girl that makes the news 
 
 i break down 
 
 boy, you're going to carry that weight, 
 carry that weight a long time 
 boy, you're going to carry that weight, 
 carry that weight a long time 
 boy, you're going to carry that weight, 
 carry that weight a long time 
 boy, your life is free 
 but it's so fine, it's sunshine 
 it's the word, love 
 
 say you don't need no diamond ring and i'll come to you 
 
 since you left me that i love you, oh 
 you're gonna say you you 
 cos i'm the one who won your love 
 but if you want our love to last an old time, i just stuttered yip yip boom 
 i couldn't stop myself from calling 
 well look a-there, look a-there 
 wow look out. 
 
 she said you hurt her so 
 she almost lost the many all you near your love 
 what grow so feels so right now 
 
 went out helter skelter helter skelter
