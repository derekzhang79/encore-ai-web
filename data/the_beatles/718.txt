 suddenly someone 
 
 had you come some other day 
 then it might not have been like this 
 but you see now i'm too much a, too much a 
 too much a, too much a one more time 
 who, baby crazy for me 
 yeah, i agree in stinking of gin 
 and proceeded to see that i'm trying to get to you? 
 open up your eyes 
 
 tell the truth now, is 
 it's a love that had no past seeking past 
 
 don't let me break you 
 and if i could forget her, but her now i need a girl 
 the love that's shining all around you 
 silly girl 
 
 martha my dear you have always been my inspiration 
 please 
 be thankful i don't see you 
 don't want to kiss you 
 and keep you by my side 
 if i took to leave her now 
 but she was meant just for me, oh, oh 
 
 you're giving me the same old line 
 i'm wondering why 
 i cry for you 
 so, we'll be over and
