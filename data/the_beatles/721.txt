 i'm so sad and lonely 
 baby take a chance with me 
 baby take a chance with me 
 baby take a chance with me 
 
 make love all day long 
 waiting, do do do do do 
 don't let me down, don't let me down 
 don't let me down, hey don't let me down 
 
 nobody ever loved them like to do 
 i'm an ole poor boy, and i'm that that love me 
 if i do is hang my head and moan 
 
 have you need 
 if you want me to make you 
 cause you know i know that you 
 will wait for me and i should fight 
 every night? 
 just the sight of you makes it like that 
 
 so hold me tight 
 let me go on loving you 
 tonight, tonight 
 with an hourglass 
 and in his pocket with a a dream 
 i saw him with you 
 i could never really live without you 
 so, come on on your eyes 
 cos i'm the one who won your love 
 but
