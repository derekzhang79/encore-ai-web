 she would not leave her number 
 but i don't know why 
 i don't mind 
 shine, the weather's fine 
 
 i need a break and i want that's what i want that's what i want that's what i want 
 that's what i want that's what i want that's what i want 
 that's what i want that's what i want that's what i want that's what i want 
 
 money don't get her back again 
 because i know you never even try, 
 the only girl for me 
 so i sing a song of love, julia 
 julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me 
 so i won't be there with you 
 
 gonna tell your mama 
 i want to stay there 
 if she turns up while i'm gone please let me know 
 
 the children wait a minute 
 you gotta check it and see, one more time 
 who, keep your hands keep your hands keep your hands keep your hands keep your hands off my baby 
 you better watch yourself now it me 
 
 oh i find you 
 your song
