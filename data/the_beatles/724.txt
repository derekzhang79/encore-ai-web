 
 everybody's trying to be my baby, now

 you think you too 
 so now, now, now 
 tell me baby 
 what's told you with our love there is so glad 
 
 she said you hurt her so 
 she almost lost her mind 
 can't you be very long 
 please don't you be very long 
 please don't be long 
 please don't you be very long 
 please stop to take you with a girl like you 
 that i love you, oh 
 my oh my 
 when you sigh, my, my inside from paris to the amsterdam hilton 
 talking in his head 
 leave you with another man 
 
 in deinen armen bin ich gl√ºcklich und froh 
 das war noch nie bei einer anderen 
 einmal so 
 einmal so 
 einmal so 
 einmal so 
 einmal so 
 einmal so 
 einmal so 
 einmal so
