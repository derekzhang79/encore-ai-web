 if i knew what i does 
 i said something wrong, now i said today 
 i've got to do 
 i've got to learn to dance 
 if it takes you all night and day 
 i need you 
 i get shy from the eyes you know, oh yeah 
 
 you can talk to you 
 if you want your moderation, get away, leave me up in you 
 and you've got time to rectify 
 all you want me to when you never even try, girl 
 she ought to think twice 
 she ought to do right by me 
 
 well if you want me to, i will 
 i wouldn't mind 
 i will say the only words i know 
 
 that the singer's going to sing a song 
 and he could sing and out of style 
 but they're guaranteed to raise a smile 
 so won't you come out to play? 
 
 dear prudence, greet the brand new day 
 the sun is shining down 
 burns my feet as they touch the ground 
 
 good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine 
 good
