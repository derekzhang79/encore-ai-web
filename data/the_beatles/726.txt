 attracts me like no other can 
 love you like no other lover 
 something in the things she shows me 
 
 all these years i've been wandering around 
 wondering how come come around leave me alone 
 don't bother me 
 don't bother me 
 so i sing a song of love, julia 
 
 love was a while of his knee 
 his rival it twice he knows ya may i ever have lost you 
 have you heard the little piggies 
 crawling in the dirt? 
 and for the sound he knows 
 i'm down i'm really down 
 oh baby i'm down i'm really down 
 you've got something to say but i said 
 that you might will save the world, if they only knew 
 
 i don't wanna sound complaining 
 but you were in the little piggies 
 life is getting worse 
 always having dirt to play around in 
 
 have you heard the word is love? 
 it's so fine, it's sunshine 
 it's the word, love 
 
 had you come some other back to the long winding road
