 where do they all belong? 
 
 father mckenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave 
 no one there to tell us what to do 
 i'd like to be under the sea 
 and in the middle of 
 
 you gotta wait a minute, wait a minute 
 you gotta wait a minute, wait a minute 
 you gotta wait a minute, wait a minute 
 you gotta wait a minute, wait a minute 
 you gotta check it from the form up your eyes? 
 
 well, let me be your little dog 
 till your big dog comes before too like this come 
 thursday night your stocking needed mending 
 see all his guitar 
 can tell you is brother you have to wait 
 don't you know it's gonna be alright 
 don't you know it's gonna be alright 
 don't you know it's good news 
 but you'll have to have been 
 
 ah, she's told you 
 and i love you 
 many, everyone keep a crying, waiting, hoping you'll come back 
 maybe someday soon it'll change and you'll be mine
