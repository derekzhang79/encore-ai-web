 this boy wants you back again 
 
 oh, money that's i will never thought of ourselves 
 is leaving how 
 yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 
 yeah, yeah 
 she loves you, now 
 oh how, i've been been gone 
 
 so i lit a fire, isn't it good, norwegian wood? 
 
 she asked me to stay and she told the girl of all these times i've really done 
 when the rain comes down 
 and i will sing a lullaby 
 
 golden slumbers fill the ship 
 bompa bom chop the tree 
 bompa bom skip the rope 
 bompa bom look at me all 
 cos you waiting to me 
 you'll let me tell you how it will be 
 there's no time when i'm alone 
 
 i told you about the walrus of the king 
 
 i can't believe 
 that she would leave 
 till your big dog comes 
 all the lonely people ah, lonely winter 
 little darling, it feels like years since it's been home 
 come off your battlefield 
 
 lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void
