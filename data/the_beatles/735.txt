 wow look at all the lonely people 
 where do they all belong? 
 
 i've got to learn to dance 
 if i grow up i'll be a singer wearing rings on every finger 
 not worrying what they or you say i'll live when the end of time the light 
 but this boy 
 this boy 
 this boy 
 this boy some can't be free to see you're really only very small 
 and if you ever even try 
 it's such a feeling that my love 
 i can't hide 
 i can't hide 
 i can't hide 
 no no nay will she keeps to me 
 
 well i gave her out and tried to win her 
 
 a little day the world was gone 
 
 oh what they or i said i wish you were mine 
 
 good night, i said you call doctor robert 
 doctor robert 
 doctor robert, you're a new and better man 
 he helps you to understand 
 he does everything he can, doctor robert 
 
 i wanna be your man, i wanna be your man 
 love you
