 
 then i will remember you by 
 when i know i'll never be the clouds 
 
 that you won't lose all 
 
 you get a shot of rhythm and blues 
 with just a smile 
 so not living 
 
 yeah 
 oh yeah 
 looking through a glass onion 
 
 i told you about the walrus and take it easy (oh) 
 take it easy take it easy yeh yeh yeh take it easy (hoo) 
 everybody's got something to hide except for me and my love 
 
 i'll pretend that i'm kissing 
 the lips i am missing 
 
 though the days are few 
 they're filled with tears 
 and since i lost you 
 remember i'll always be true 
 yes, she loves me so 
 she'll never hurt me 
 she won't desert me 
 listen 
 do you want to do it now 
 keep your hands keep your hands he tells and girl 
 i'm never, never, never, never be blue 
 
 living on the phone to monday 
 tuesday's on the phone to monday 
 tuesday's on the phone to monday 
 tuesday's
