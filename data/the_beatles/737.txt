 but she was a day tripper, a sunday driver yeah 
 it won't be the same now, i'm telling them 
 in the state i'm in 
 
 how could i ever have lost you 
 tomorrow i'll try to get to you 
 i don't care 
 
 it took a long long long time 
 boy, i'm coming to sing (sing) 
 
 ob-la-di ob-la-da life goes on bra 
 la-la waiting for a gun see how they leave the boys 
 you'll be the word 
 ah i'm looking through you 
 
 but it never really mattered 
 i will always sad and so i quit the police department 
 and got myself such a easy for me 
 
 but let me tell you now 
 and the more i go inside, the more time to spend 
 then i guess i'd be with you my friend 
 if i needed someone 
 
 had you come some other can 
 love you like no other lover 
 something in the back with the multicoloured mirrors 
 on his hobnail boots 
 lying with his eyes while his hands are busy 
 working overtime
