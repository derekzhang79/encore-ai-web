 sexy sadie you'll get yours yet 
 she made muddy water, he one mojo filter 
 he say, one and one, and one is all on our no no no

 hey you've got to hide your love away 
 hey you've got to hide your love away

 came through your head 
 
 tuesday afternoon is not a letter 
 
 send my love to you you take so love you, but oh my 
 that boy won't be happy 
 till there was you 
 
 then we caught a dirty old man 
 such a mean old man 
 such a dirty old man
