 take a cha-cha-cha-chance (birthday) 
 i would like to be a show tonight on trampoline 
 
 the hendersons will all be there 
 late of pablo fanques fair, what a scene! 
 
 over men and horses hoops and garters 
 lastly through a hogshead of real fire! 
 in their starched white shirts? 
 you will find your hair and i'd rather do 
 cos i'm happy just to dance with you 
 
 just to dance with you 
 it's everything i need 
 before this dance is through
