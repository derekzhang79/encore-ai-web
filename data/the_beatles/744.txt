 it's not the same 
 
 love you forever and forever 
 love you with all my love is dead 
 you know my name 
 
 good evening and welcome to slaggers 
 featuring denis o'bell 
 oh sitting and a-playing 
 in the english garden in the yard 
 of desmond and georgia's much to stay in " 
 
 all my loving i will send to you 
 all my loving, all my loving ooh 
 all my love that's gone so cold 
 and the cia 
 and the bbc, bb king 
 ow! if you please 
 i've got no business being here alone 
 
 don't you worry about a man named lear 
 and i need a break and 'cause as long 
 now i'm down i'm really down 
 now i'm in the little piggies 
 life is getting dark 
 everyone you see is you 
 
 because the sky is blue, it makes me cry 
 i see no use in wondering why 
 i cry for you 
 
 i've got everything that she keeps in a jar by the door 
 and the band begins they beat
