 but she wants to know 
 and all the fun we had it 
 but the love 
 the movies gonna make me a big star

 and all i gotta do 
 is call you on the phone 
 and to sing 'you really got a hold for me 
 you is very long 
 please don't be long 
 please don't you be very long 
 please don't you be very long 
 please don't be long 
 please don't you be very sad 
 so way it hurt me so
