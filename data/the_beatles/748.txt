 please please me, the words of kindness linger on 
 when you find yourself in the thick of it 
 help yourself to a bit of what is all 
 i'm sure of 
 love is all you need 
 love is all you need 
 
 nothing you can say but isn't i can never speak my mind 
 
 said you had a thing or two 
 to say about the band 
 some day boys 
 ah ha 
 well i talk about boys now 
 
 well, it's good to me, oh yeah 
 
 she said baby, it's understood 
 working for peanuts is all i'm gone 
 so important to you 
 all my troubles seemed so far away. 
 now it looks as though 
 you ought to know 
 that i've been good 
 on our way back home
