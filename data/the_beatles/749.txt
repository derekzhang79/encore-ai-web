 cos they play so loud 
 but i still love her 
 
 bright on the ground i'm really down 
 well baby i'm down 
 how can you laugh when you pay the rent 
 did you think that money just can't go on anymore 
 
 please remember how i feel about you 
 i get shy when they start to stare 
 i'm gonna hide myself away, ay hay 
 but i'd have never been aware 
 but as it looks good

 oh baby i'm down 
 how can you laugh when you get it 
 everyone's saying it 
 flowing more freely than wine 
 all through your life 
 
 you want her, you need a love that's true 
 it's me 
 cos i won't be there with you 
 and i'm always thinking of you 
 
 because the world is round...aaaaaahhhhhh 
 
 because the wind is high it blows my mind
