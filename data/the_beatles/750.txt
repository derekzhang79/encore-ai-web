 we'll go on and on 
 someday when we're dreaming 
 deep in love, way 
 but your time, won't you think of me 
 cos i won't be there with you 
 
 oh so i looked and there's no fun in a dirty old man 
 such a mean old man 
 such a dirty old man 
 i'll never leave her 
 
 she said, listen baby i got something to say 
 i let you share what's you 
 a i'm the kind of guy 
 who never used to cry 
 when she learns we are two 
 cos i couldn't stand the world 
 
 but when i saw him with you 
 love her 
 
 because the world is hard to take you away 
 hoping to take you away 
 hoping to keep you 
 i want you so 
 you'll understand 
 cos you like me too much and i like you 
 
 i don't wanna sound complaining 
 but you don't get me, you don't get me 
 
 you can't do me no harm oo-oo oh yeah
