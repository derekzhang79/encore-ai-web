 but she isn't 
 
 she's a woman who loves her man

 you've really got a long long time 
 now i'm so alone 
 now you're coming, you're coming on home 
 i'll never put you there

 let it be, let it be 
 whisper words of wisdom, let it be

 it's i so unwise, ah, the day 
 
 give the word a steady job 
 and all i gotta do 
 is thank you girl, thank you girl
