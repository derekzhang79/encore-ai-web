 
 and the same old man 
 
 and nobody seems to like him 
 
 don't want to cry when there's people there 
 i wonder what went wrong i've waited far too long 
 i can see you, be you 
 how can i ever misplace you 
 how i want you 
 oh i love you 
 i'll never do you no harm 
 believe me when i tell you 
 i'll never do you no harm 
 believe me when i beg you, ooh 
 don't ever leave me alone 
 she knows a woman's place 
 is leaving never a long long long time 
 how a day tripper, a sunday driver all the long 
 i am the walrus, goo goo g' joob 
 
 mister postman look and see 
 is there a letter in your bag for me 
 i know that you will when to see you in the ground 
 they'll fill you in with all my mind, julia 
 
 julia, julia, good morning and save the wife had me, oh 
 you just see the meaning of within 
 it is no surprise now, what you see
