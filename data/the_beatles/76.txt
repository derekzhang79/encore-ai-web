 
 i remember the first time 
 i call your name 
 i call your name 
 i call your name 
 i call your name 
 i call your name 
 i call your name 
 i call your name 
 i call your name 
 but you'll have to have them all pulled out 
 after the savoy truffle 
 
 cool cherry cream, nice apple tart 
 i feel good and i see someone 
 
 if the rain comes they run and tell your mama 
 i want you to do 
 is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me 
 tighter 
 tighter 
 
 1,2, 1,2,3,4 
 
 here, you need a shot of rhythm and blues 
 i roll a stoney 
 well you can dance 
 i know you never even try, girl 
 i think you know your misery 
 
 mm mm mm mm mm mm mm 
 da da da da da da da 
 d'da d'da d'da d'da da d'da d'da d'da d'da d'da how 
 
 and it really knock me out 
 
 don't let
