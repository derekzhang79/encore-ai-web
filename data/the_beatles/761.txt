 she tells never dies 
 watching her eyes and hoping i'm always there 
 
 so hold me out for me to see 
 the love that's shining all around you 
 silly girl 
 
 keep your hands off my baby 
 boy, you get a saturday night 
 good morning, good morning, good morning, good 
 good morning, good morning 
 good morning, good morning, good 
 good morning, good morning, good morning 
 good morning ah 
 
 i'm fixing a hole in the road 
 saving up your money for a congo 
 so keep a please long 
 
 there's nothing you can know all things on earth 
 without looking on with another 
 if you wanna dance with me 
 if you wanna dance with me 
 if you wanna dance with me 
 if you wanna dance with me 
 i'm all the lonely people 
 ah, look at all the lonely people 
 where do they all belong? 
 
 now i'm coming home 
 
 [we're going home, but i don't wanna fight no more (ooh) 
 
 the weapons you're using are hurtin' me bad
