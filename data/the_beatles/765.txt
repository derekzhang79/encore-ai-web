 as i looked up to see i've had the pleasure to say 
 her majesty's a pretty nice girl 
 someday i'm going to make her mine, oh yeah 
 someday i'm going to make her mine, oh yeah 
 someday you're going to keep me with you 
 but, ah, but, in fact, baby it's " 
 [paul:] don't do 
 go 'round my head 
 the come of our lives 
 
 take a hole where you were i'll seen the little piggies 
 crawling in the streets 
 leave me up a creek 
 i can't turn away 
 and in the evening she's a singer with the band 
 
 yes you should see polythene pam 
 she's so good-looking but she looks like a man 
 some kind of innocence is measured out in miles 
 what makes you think you're something there 
 and i held each other tight 
 and if i, i wanna kiss you yeah 
 all i gotta do is call and i'll be glad 
 i still love her
