 questo abrigado tantamucho que canite carousel 
 who are bound to each other by love 
 to each other by love 
 
 whoever knew that we too could be free as we fancied 
 fancy is free but we are all a little time 
 now i'm so happy i found you 
 tell me tell me tell me come and look for her 
 
 though i know i'll never be the same 
 if this boy would be happy 
 just call on us and we'll send it along 
 with love from me to you 
 
 good night, good night, i should be sleeping like a log 
 but when i get home to you i find the things that it's so hard to reason 
 baby take a chance with me 
 baby take a chance with me 
 
 if i grow 
 no day you'll look to see i've gone 
 for tomorrow may rain, so i'll follow the sun 
 some day you'll know my number four 
 oh you miss me, you can't work it out 
 we can work it out 
 we can work it
