 and i know what you've got means such a lot to me 
 
 it won't be happy 
 when i feel blue 
 and it's true that it really only goes to show 
 that i know that i just need you on 
 
 woke up, fell out of bed 
 dragged a comb across my head 
 found my way downstairs and drank a cup 
 and looking up, i noticed i was fractured yip yip boom 
 yes she is free i said so come on, come on, come on, come on 
 so come on, come on, come on, come on 
 come on, come on, come on, come on... 
 
 well early in the morning 
 why don't we do it in the road? 
 no one else can make that road 
 when i feel blue 
 i'm living every moment girl for you 
 
 but you don't believe in a love 
 and all i gotta do 
 is thank you girl, thank you girl 
 
 the act you've known for all these years 
 sgt. pepper taught the band to play
