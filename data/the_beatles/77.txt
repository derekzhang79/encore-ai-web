 good morning ah 
 
 i'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in 
 stops my mind from wandering 
 where it will go oh please 
 and go where you're going to 
 think for yourself 
 cos i won't be there with you 
 
 you know you made me cry 
 because the sky is blue, it makes me cry 
 and all i gotta do 
 is thank you girl, thank you girl 
 
 thank you, uh, ha ha ha ha! 
 see how they smile like pigs in a sty, see how he please 
 
 he used to think twice 
 she ought to do right by me 
 
 i don't break to 
 isn't he a bit like you and me? 
 
 nowhere man, please listen 
 you don't want the break of day 
 sitting in the sky with diamonds 
 lucy in the sky with diamonds 
 lucy in the sky with diamonds 
 lucy in the sky with diamonds 
 lucy in the sky with diamonds 
 lucy in the sky with diamonds 
 lucy in the sky with diamonds 
 aaaaahhhhh...
