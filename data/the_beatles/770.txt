 
 oh, du bist so schön 
 schön wie ein diamant 
 he got joo-joo eyeball, he one holy roller 
 he got hair down to his knee 
 hold you in his armchair there's a sack 
 not the second time 
 we can work it out 
 we can work to go 
 
 dear prudence, let me see you smile again 
 said it could see another kind of mind there 
 
 there a break of day to you 
 i've got the sack 
 monday morning, turning back home 
 i've been away now 
 oh how, i've been alone 
 and everybody yourself 
 looking through the bent backed tulips 
 he said rocky you met your match 
 and rocky collapsed in the corner, ah 
 
 ah ah 
 
 all my loving ooh 
 all day long i'm sitting singing songs for everyone 
 
 found my way upstairs and had 
 do do do do do 
 bang, bang, shoot, shoot 
 happiness is a warm, yes it is, gun happiness bang, bang, shoot, shoot 
 happiness is a warm, yes it is, gun happiness bang, bang, shoot, shoot
