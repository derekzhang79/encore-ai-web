 
 she's got the devil in her heart 
 oh, no, no, no, not a second time 
 only girl 
 
 hold your head up you silly girl look like a " oh oh oh 
 rose and valerie screaming from the gallery 
 say he must go free maxwell must go free maxwell must go free maxwell must go free maxwell must go free 
 the clouds will be a daisy chain 
 so let me see you smile again 
 dear prudence, won't you let me see you smile? 
 
 child-like 
 no no sometimes, ever that 
 
 and if you really like you want it to 
 because... 
 
 oh i can't sleep at night 
 you may think the chords are going 
 they're so low 
 till i gotta do 
 
 and our friends are all his life 
 you were above a girl like you 
 the world was waiting for a little peace of mind 
 i'd give you everything i had 
 but i can't get through 
 i am the walrus, goo goo g' joob 
 goo gooooooooooo jooba
