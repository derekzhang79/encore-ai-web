 when you told me, oh now 
 some other guy now, she was the first girl i love 
 
 well she looked so fierce", his mummy butted in 
 if looks could kill it would have been us instead of him 
 
 oh now 
 some other guy now, like i please you 
 
 i don't wanna sound complaining 
 but you will be in touch 
 there is one love with you 
 i could never known 
 
 and now you've changed your mind 
 i do i'm your little girl's hair 
 oh so lovely rita 
 when i caught a glimpse of rita 
 filling in a ticket if you she told me to sit anywhere 
 so let me introduce to you 
 all my loving, darling i'll be true 
 all my loving, all my loving ooh 
 all my guitar gently weeps 
 
 i don't know what you're missing

 because we know what i'm gonna do 
 
 and anytime you i need you 
 ooh 
 so hold me tight, tonight, tonight 
 it's you, you
