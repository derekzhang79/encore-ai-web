 it's time to say good night 
 mmmmmm 
 mmmmmm 
 mmmmmmmmmm 
 
 close your eyes and i'll kiss you 
 tomorrow i'll miss you 
 remember i'll always be true 
 so please, love me do 
 whoa, love me do 
 
 someone to love last again 
 
 i want to tell her that i love her a lot 
 but i never saw them winging 
 no, i never thought i knew you, what did i know? 
 you don't know what you see 
 when the rain comes down 
 i'm not home to see 
 that if i ran away from you 
 oh oh hoho 
 yeah baby i'm down 
 
 honey pie you are making me crazy 
 i'm in love with you 
 i'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same 
 and i held her hand in mine... 
 
 she's got the fever 
 changing my life with the wave of her hand 
 she leave me and feeling like this i can't want 
 she's a woman, she's a woman 
 but you don't get past my bed
