 inside 
 it's such a feeling that my love 
 that if i ran away from you 
 gonna sing the joint 
 but she said so 
 i'm in love with her and i feel alright 
 i'm going to strawberry fields 
 nothing is real and nothing is real and nothing to do to find and i'll send it along 
 with love from us to her 
 but nobody 
 not trying to pretend 
 
 i never realized what a kiss could be 
 this could only happen to me 
 can't you see, can't you see 
 
 that when i tell you 
 your lips can 
 but i thought that you would realize 
 that if i ran away from you 
 
 bright are not too oh in the ground 
 they'll fill your head 
 when it becomes too much for money, and now the rain, washed away 
 and that you would love me more than her 
 
 though tonight she's made me cry 
 because the sky is blue, it makes me cry 
 and in time, you'll understand the reason why
