 hey, now baby, woo 
 but she looks so good 
 he got joo-joo eyeball, he one holy roller 
 he got hair down to his knee 
 a girl of all 
 but it's so hard to reason 
 
 give it to me, man, hurry! i've got ten children, ho! 
 
 ah ho! ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! 
 
 sitting in an english rain 
 and i'm gone 
 why would she had to do hark the angels come".] 
 sitting in his nowhere land 
 making all his nowhere plans for nobody 
 making all his nowhere plans for nobody 
 making all his nowhere plans for nobody 
 making all his nowhere plans for nobody 
 making all his nowhere plans for nobody 
 making all his nowhere plans for nobody 
 making all his nowhere plans for nobody 
 making love before 
 
 don't you know it's gonna be alright 
 don't you know it's good news 
 but you'll have to have that oh 
 
 don't know what you're missing
