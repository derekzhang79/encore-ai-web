 try to make it shine 
 there's nothing i would rather do 
 i've been away now 
 oh how, i've been alone 
 for so many years bye bye 
 
 think about a show you hope she knew you 
 believe me when i tell you 
 i'll never do you no harm 
 believe me darling 
 
 it took me years 
 
 floating more around here 
 the more i learn, the way you never know, see 
 
 that if i could not say 
 
 and from your beam you made my dream 
 and from the first time that she really done me 
 oh, she done me, she done me good 
 
 don't let him 
 so the wife called me and we'd better go to see 
 she said so 
 i'm in love with you 
 i'm so glad that she's my little girl 
 she's so glad, she's telling all the world 
 
 that her baby buys her things, you know 
 she tells me all the time, you know 
 she said 
 so ah 
 
 i'm fixing a hole in the ocean
