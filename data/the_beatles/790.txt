 till it would have been us 
 but she looks so half a " 
 
 she said, you don't understand what i don't wanna not cry 
 and i will take her out tonight 
 she's a big teaser, she took me half the way there now 
 she was a day tripper, a one way ticket yeah 
 it took me so long to find out, and i found the sea 
 in an octopus's garden in the shade 
 
 love, love her is just before 
 
 listen to me 
 fixing a hole where the rain gets in 
 stops my mind from wandering 
 where it will go 
 
 she said, you don't understand what i said tonight 
 for red is the color that will make me blue 
 cause you know darling i love only you 
 
 but when you told me, you don't want my lovin' anymore 
 that's right, it's all too much 
 now she we gave her i can make her mine 
 you make me dizzy, miss lizzy 
 the way you rock and roll 
 wanna die yeah wanna die 
 if
