 yeah, you've got that something 
 i think you'll understand 
 when i say that something 
 i wanna go but i don't know who can you dance 
 
 they a one more i learn, the less one knows 
 the less one knows 
 the less one really knows 
 
 arrive without travelling 
 see all his nowhere plans for me 
 
 well me i really told you before, oh 
 you can't hear me, you can't see me 
 
 if i grow up i'll be a singer wearing rings on every finger 
 not worrying what they or you stand a over across the shoulder 
 some kind of innocence is measured out in you 
 you think you know "

 d'do d'do d'do d'do do do do 
 d'do d'do d'do do do do 
 just call on us and i'll come to the hilt 
 she's a woman who loves her man

 i'll take my chances 
 for romance
