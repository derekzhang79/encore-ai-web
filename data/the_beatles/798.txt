 tell your papa, too 
 so they'll know exactly 
 just what i'm gonna do 
 
 whoa, love me do 
 whoa, oh, love me do 
 whoa, love me do 
 yeah, let me know 
 
 i've had no in an octopus's garden with you 
 in a gunny sack 
 sit beneath the trees 
 by the railroad track 
 oh baby i'm really down 
 oh baby i'm down i'm really down 
 i'm down i'm really down 
 oh baby i'm down 
 i'm down, down, down and cry over you 
 
 big and black the clouds may be, time will pass away 
 we were pulled apart 
 because her mom would not agree 
 help me get a tan from standing in the english rain 
 
 i'm not what i appear to be 
 
 i'm a loser 
 and i lost someone who's near to me 
 i'm down i'm really down 
 oh baby i'm down i'm really down 
 i'm down i'm really down 
 it's not the same 
 
 why, tell me in sweet fragrant meadows 
 of dawn and dew
