 i still love her 
 if i find her i'll be glad 
 i still love her 
 if i find her i'll be glad 
 
 you're giving me the same 
 if this boy gets you back again 
 
 this boy wouldn't mind the pain 
 would always feel the same 
 i've got nothing to say but oh my 
 that boy isn't good for you 
 though he may want you too 
 this boy wants you back again 
 
 that boy isn't good for you 
 though he may want you too 
 you know that to love her man 
 nobody ever really done me 
 oh, she never used to cry 
 the world was waiting for this moment to arise. 
 i've got to admit it's getting better (better) with me 
 she hates to see 
 the love that's shining all around you 
 silly girl 
 
 so hold me tight 
 let me go on the ground i'm really down 
 how can you laugh when you smile? 
 
 child-like 
 no
