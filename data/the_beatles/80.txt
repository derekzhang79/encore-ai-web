 
 wooaah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! 
 see how they run 
 you're waiting here 
 i know i'm putting you on 
 but she doesn't know he's there 
 
 i can't believe 
 she's gonna tear your heart apart 
 cos i told you about the walrus and me, man 
 and the bag across her shoulder 
 made her look a little like a military man 
 
 lovely rita meter maid 
 may like it 
 well she looked in love with you 
 
 treasure these few words till we're together 
 keep all my love forever 
 p.s. i love you 
 i'll always be true 
 so please listen to the story 
 all the sight of you makes nighttime bright 
 very bright 
 haven't i the right 
 and i'll forgive the show 
 sgt. pepper's lonely hearts club band 
 we hope you feel that something 
 i know that she's no peasant 
 only ever has to give me love 
 
 don't want to cry 
 when the rain comes down 
 good night, good night,
