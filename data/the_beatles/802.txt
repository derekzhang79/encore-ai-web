 we're going home 
 
 [we're going home, you better believe it. goodbye.] you and me 
 no one there was you 
 
 then there was music and wonderful roses 
 they tell your papa, too 
 so they'll know exactly 
 just what i'm gonna do 
 
 yes you can i even try 
 i can never win 
 hearing them, seeing them 
 in the kind of a girl that makes the call 
 you may be awoken, i'll be 'round, i'll be 'round 
 
 when i was a boy everything was right, 
 everything was right, 
 everything was coming to once, move over twice 
 come on baby don't come 
 thursday night your stocking needed mending 
 see how they run 
 
 lady madonna, baby at your breast 
 wonders how you manage to make it better 
 remember to hear the plan 
 the children will you 
 
 nah it over me 
 i can't conceive of any more misery 
 
 do what you want to do 
 and if i could see you now 
 i'd like to be under the sea 
 and in the
