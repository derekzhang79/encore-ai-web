 
 i cry the pain 
 and i would be warm i please 
 
 she's got the devil in her if 
 your inside is out 
 so she's a dirty old man 
 
 well be dead at the door 
 the wild and windy night, that the rain, washed away 
 has a big old band 
 many years ago 
 
 floating down the street 
 baby i'm really down 
 oh baby i'm down i'm really down 
 i'm down i'm really down 
 oh baby i'm down i'm really down 
 oh baby i'm down yea 
 oh baby i'm down i'm really down 
 how can you show that my eyes 
 cos i'm the good 
 
 don't be afraid 
 you were perverted too 
 i don't know how lucky you are boy 
 having been some days in preparation 
 a splendid time is guaranteed for all 
 and the bag across her shoulder 
 made her look a little like a military man
