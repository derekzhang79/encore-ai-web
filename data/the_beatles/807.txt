 i wonder what went wrong i've waited far too long 
 i think i'll take a walk and look for her 
 
 had to keep my baby 
 you tell me it's the institution

 you tell me

 i'm gonna sit right down and cry over you 
 
 i'm taking the time 
 
 i used to think of no one else 
 but you have changed your mind 
 treat me like you did the night before 
 
 and if you ever even try 
 i'm gonna sit right down and cry over you 
 
 i can't believe it's happened to me

 i said move over honey i'm travelling on that line 
 i said move over honey i'm travelling on that line 
 i said move over honey i'm travelling on that line 
 i said move over honey i'm travelling on that
