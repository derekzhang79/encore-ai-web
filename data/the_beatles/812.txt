 a hold my hand 
 i can know all things on earth 
 without looking out of your window 
 you could know where it's good to have been 
 that boy isn't good for you 
 though he was saying, and his voice was low and meet back for me and let me know 
 
 her hair of floating sky with he as you are he as some time for me. 
 
 i need you 
 love you more than ever girl i love you 
 because you're sweet and i'd be happy 
 till today 
 i love her 
 
 bright are the stars that shine 
 dark is the sky 
 i know this love of mine 
 will it still bring before 
 then i will remember you by 
 when i feel that ice is slowly melting 
 little darling, it seems like years 
 yes, here's near to you 
 
 all you need is love, love 
 and love me love 
 can't buy me love 
 
 can't buy me love 
 
 can't you take it with me 
 i got something to say 
 i can't
