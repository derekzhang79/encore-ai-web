 sunday morning creeping like a nun 
 monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace 
 what do i not remember 
 
 i never give you my number 
 i got lips that long 
 nobody will see 
 the way things are going 
 they're going to crucify me 
 oh yeah 
 yeah i've got a girl who's waiting home for me tonight 
 
 any time at all, all you've gotta do is call and i'll be there 
 
 any time at all, doctor robert 
 doctor robert, you're a new and better man 
 he helps you to understand 
 he does everything he can, doctor robert 
 
 i wanna be your man, i wanna be your man 
 i wanna be your man, i wanna be your man 
 i wanna be your man 
 love you like no other lover 
 something in the way she moves 
 attracts me like no other lover 
 something in the way she woos me 
 
 i love you so 
 but i love you 
 
 all together now all together now 
 all together now
