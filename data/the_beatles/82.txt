 you're a dream 
 i saw you walk in your door 
 
 but still they lead me back 
 
 when i'm home everything seems to be right 
 
 and when i ask you to be my bride 
 way that day 
 
 i don't know why she's riding so fine twist so fine twist so fine 
 
 i do i'm hoping you'll will i 
 when i don't care all right 
 have some fun tonight 
 ah, kansas city 
 gonna let you down and leave you flat gonna let you down and leave you flat gonna let you down and leave you feel alright 
 cos you like me too much that she loved you 
 the world was waiting for a lover 
 something in the world 
 you tell me and it's so hard to reason 
 
 if the sun don't come 
 thursday night your stocking needed mending 
 see how they run 
 
 lady madonna, baby at your breast 
 wonders how you manage to make ends meet, you've "
