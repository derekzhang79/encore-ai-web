 but you're all the same 
 if this boy gets you back again 
 
 this boy 
 this boy wouldn't mind 
 yes you can never tell 
 the movies gonna make me a big star night 
 oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 honey pie, honey pie you are driving me frantic 
 sail across the atlantic 
 to be the door 
 and now she is mine 
 i think i'll love you too 
 i'm the kind of a girl i love you 
 
 everywhere i ain't no fool around and my dreams 
 tonight? 
 
 friday night arrives without a suitcase 
 sunday morning creeping like a nun 
 monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace 
 what they make their way across the universe 
 thoughts meander with the girl i love you 
 you, i love you, honey pie you are driving me
