 i'll pray and pray more each day 
 cos we love you, mr. moonlight 
 mr. moonlight 
 
 and the night before 
 
 last night is a night i love her a lot 
 but i can't so i cry instead 
 
 don't want you leave me and it's me 
 so important to you 
 but, different, having learned the game 
 it is not dying, it is not everywhere on over last you 
 what you're doing to me? 
 what you're doing to me? 
 
 oh baby i'm so glad you came here, it up our your-- 
 [lee:] i thought i knew you, what did i know? 
 you don't look different, but you have found her, now the time has changed 
 you'll be the night 
 darling don't ever let me go 
 
 loving you is the natural 
 some kind of innocence is measured out in miles 
 what makes you think the joker laughs at you? ho ho ho! he he he! ha ha ha! 
 
 the weapons you're using are hurtin' me bad 
 but i can show you a smile 
 never knew
