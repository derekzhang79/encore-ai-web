 well, gonna know all together 
 you know my name and the number you know you know my name 
 ba ba baby, some fun tonight 
 
 well i beg you on my bended knees 
 if you'll only listen to my pleas 
 
 don't let me down 
 
 don't let me down, don't let me down 
 don't let me down, don't let me down 
 don't let me down, hey don't let me down 
 
 don't let him 
 steal your heart away 
 well i've got to be just like you want my face to the love 
 
 don't wake me, no, don't shake me 
 leave me here in misery 
 
 boy, you're gonna do 
 i've got to learn to dance 
 if it takes you all night and day 
 
 come on, give me fever 
 put your little hand in mine 
 i could know the old things man 
 can i get through? 
 can't you try to see that i'm trying to get mad 
 
 i want you 
 i want you to do 
 is just hold me, hold
