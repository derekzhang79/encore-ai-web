 
 everybody seems like a yellow submarine 
 yellow submarine, yellow submarine 
 we all live in a yellow submarine 
 we all live in a yellow submarine 
 yellow submarine, yellow submarine 
 
 we all live in a yellow submarine 
 yellow submarine, yellow submarine 
 we all live in a yellow submarine 
 she tells me all the time, you know 
 she said so 
 i'm in love with you 
 and all i gotta do 
 is thank you girl, thank you girl 
 
 one day in my head 
 you me that i don't know 
 you will love me more than her 
 
 all the lonely people 
 
 eleanor rigby picks up the rice in the church and one more thing, girl 
 you give back your ring to me, 
 it's the institution 
 but you don't understand what i said tonight 
 for red is the color that my happiness don't make it can't be done 
 cos i told you once before goodbye 
 but i thought that you would realize 
 that if i sang out of tune 
 would you stand up and walk
