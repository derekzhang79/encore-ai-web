 and looking up, from the first things that you do 
 
 love, love me more than her 
 
 though tonight she's made me cry 
 because the world can start to sing (sing) 
 
 ob-la-di ob-la-da life goes on bra 
 la-la how the life of blue 
 and i'll send it here 
 but i need you 
 don't bother me 
 
 i don't know why she's riding so high 
 she ought to think twice 
 she ought to do right by me 
 before she gets to her she begins to sing (sing) 
 well it's all the friends they returned me to 
 two pounds ten a week, that was my pay 
 yes she was a girl in a million, my friend 
 i should have known she would win in the road 
 saving up to buy some clothes 
 keeps a ten-bob note up his nose 
 such a mean old man 
 such a dirty old man 
 dirty old man 
 such a mean old man 
 
 a lifetime is so short 
 a new one can't go 
 but lives
