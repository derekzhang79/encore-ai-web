 can i have memories 
 longer than the road that stretches out ahead 
 
 two of us wearing raincoats 
 standing so low 
 in the sun 
 the skys are gone 
 i mean you 
 i get shy when they start to stare 
 i'm gonna hide myself away, ay hay 
 but you'll have to go 
 you'll be thinking of me

 oh yeah 
 now i can show you i'm 
 
 as i looked up to see your day 
 
 i want to tell you 
 i think you know 
 
 i've been waiting here for you 
 wond'ring what you're sweet 
 yes, she said, it's all within yourself 
 no one alerted you
