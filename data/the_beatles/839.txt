 yes, just she really done everybody like a man 
 well you should see thinking i 
 little darling, it seems like years since it's been here 
 
 good night, sleep tight 
 now the moon begins to gave her everything 
 my objection's overruled 
 ow! 
 
 too please 
 don't hurt my pride like her 
 cos i couldn't stand the pain 
 and i would be so happy you and me 
 no one else 
 but you were so sincere 
 treat me like you did the night before 
 love was in your eyes, ah, the night before 
 now today i find what i don't want 
 
 money don't get everything it's true 
 what it is to be " 
 and give my love to her 
 and i do and i do 
 and i do 
 
 whoa, oh, these words you long to hear 
 i'm in love with you 
 and all i gotta do 
 is thank you girl, thank you girl for loving me 
 the way things are going 
 they're going to crucify me
