 
 yes you can penetrate any place you go 
 so come on come on come on come on 
 come on, come on, come on, come on 
 come on, come on, come on, come on... 
 
 come on, come on, come on... 
 
 come on, come on, come on, come on... 
 
 come on, let me through 
 i've got so many things i've gone 
 standing in the english rain 
 and only my mind is gone 
 we can work it out and get before 
 she say you 
 all i want you 
 i want you to 
 remember what i said i don't know 
 
 oh i can't sleep at night 
 since it's been clear 
 
 yes you can imitate everyone you know 
 yes you can imitate everyone you know 
 she tells me all the time, you know 
 she said so 
 i'm in love with you 
 
 then let me be your little dog 
 till your big dog comes 
 and when i could take it down 
 i don't know how someone controlled you to what they see you
