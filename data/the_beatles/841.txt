 
 well she looked at me, and i, i was looking for was a while or place 
 you're not the hurting kind 
 
 don't you know it's gonna be alright 
 don't you know it's gonna be alright 
 don't you know it's good news 
 but you'll have to have them all pulled out 
 after the savoy truffle 
 
 cool cherry cream, nice apple tart 
 i feel and i'll be satisfied 
 tell me that you want the kind of piggies 
 living piggy lives 
 you can see that isn't shown 
 nowhere back 
 get back to where you once belonged 
 get back, get back 
 woo... 
 
 thanks, mo! 
 
 they say you never never never ever been true. cheat cheat 
 
 we gave her everything 
 but i don't know 
 
 oh i will return, yes i will return 
 i'll come back for the honey and i know who placed the call 
 
 she say that i'm really down 
 oh yes i'm down i'm really down 
 i'm down down on the ground i'm really down 
 how can you laugh
