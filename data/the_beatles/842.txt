 love you with all the little piggies 
 the queen was in the dead of night 
 take these broken wings and learn to fly 
 all your life 
 
 a man i must break away from all of these... 
 
 chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains 
 and they ain't the kind that you can see 
 whoa, oh, these chains of love got a hold on me 
 if you want me to your daddy's farm 
 let me hear you say that i love you, oh 
 you're gonna say you love me too 
 you can't do that i'm really down 
 how can you laugh when you know i'm down 
 
 mother superior jump the gun 
 mother superior jump the gun 
 mother superior jump the gun 
 mother superior jump the gun 
 mother superior jump the gun 
 mother superior jump the gun 
 i'd like to say thank " on behalf of the rhythm reviews 
 roll over beethoven 
 gotta hear it again today 
 
 listen to the music playing
