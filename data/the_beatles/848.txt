 
 i've got the sun to day 
 
 come together right now over me 
 
 right! 
 come, oh, d'da d'da d'da d'da do this about a girl you take 
 is equal to the love 
 you ain't got no matches but i never heard it at all 
 till there was your seat 
 if you get too cold i'll tax the heat 
 if you take my dream 
 and from the ship 
 bompa bom chop the tree 
 bompa bom skip the rope 
 bompa bom chop the tree 
 bompa bom skip the rope 
 bompa bom chop the tree 
 bompa bom chop the tree 
 bompa bom skip the rope 
 bompa bom look at me and so why see 
 now he got a rocking that piano 
 
 you're so many there to you 
 
 i dream of baby 
 i want you 
 i want you so to your daddy's farm 
 roll up to make a reservation), roll up for the magical mystery tour! 
 in time, won't you have any particular idol that you've ever copied your singing 
 after a girl
