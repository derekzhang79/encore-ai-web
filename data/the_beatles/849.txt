 
 have got their a lot to say 
 her majesty's a pretty nice girl 
 but she doesn't have a lot to say 
 i do all the pleasing in free 
 the world was waiting for a girl 
 she's sweeter than all the girls and oh yeah 
 
 i want you 
 i want you 
 i want you so bad 
 it's driving me mad 
 
 she's so heavy 
 she's so heavy 
 she's so heavy 
 heavy, heavy, heavy 
 
 she's so heavy 
 heavy, heavy, heavy 
 
 she's so heavy 
 she's so heavy 
 she's so heavy 
 for a yellow submarine 
 yellow submarine, yellow submarine 
 we just live in a yellow submarine 
 we all live in a yellow submarine 
 she hates may mourn the dead 
 
 if you don't take her out tonight 
 she's going to change her mind 
 and i will take a sad song and make it better 
 remember to let her under your skin 
 then you begin to make it better 
 
 and you're working for no one i am able
