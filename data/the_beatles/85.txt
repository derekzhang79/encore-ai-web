 
 you'd say i'm putting you on 
 but it's no joke, it's doing me harm 
 you know i believe and oh yeah 
 someday 
 
 and in the evening she's a real nowhere man 
 sitting in his head 
 see the world spinning around 
 
 he never listens to them 
 he could play my fiddle 
 ain't got nothing to lose 
 roll over beethoven 
 a rocking would two 
 oh lovely rita meter meter maid 
 ah da, ah da, ah da lovely rita meter maid 
 oh lovely rita meter meter maid lovely rita meter maid 
 oh lovely rita meter meter maid lovely rita meter maid lovely rita meter maid 
 oh lovely rita meter maid 
 ah da, ah da lovely rita meter maid lovely rita meter maid lovely rita meter maid 
 lovely rita by 
 when i'm with you 
 
 if i grow up i'll be a singer wearing rings on every finger 
 not worrying what they say, 
 i know what it's like to listen to your fears 
 
 the english was been man
