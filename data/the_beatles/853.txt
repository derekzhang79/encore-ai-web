 you know i believe and how

 oh i get by with a little help from my friends 
 mm i get high with a little help if to say

 someday i'm going to make her out 
 
 don't you know it's gonna be alright 
 don't you know it's gonna be alright 
 don't you know it's gonna be alright 
 don't you know it's gonna be alright 
 don't you know it's gonna be alright
