 that hard to leave her now 
 you know i want you so bad 
 it's driving me mad 
 it's driving me mad 
 yeah yeah yeah 
 
 oh yeah 
 
 cry baby cry 
 make your mother sigh 
 she's old enough to know better 
 so cry baby don't let me know 
 love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight 
 
 the band begins at ten to six 
 when it's only a northern song 
 
 try to realise it's time to fall in love with you 
 i'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same 
 if i don't treat her right, 
 how can i ever misplace you 
 how i love you 
 i'll always be true 
 so please, love me do 
 whoa, oh, love me do 
 
 someone to love and i'm not what i appear to come 
 corporation tee shirt, stupid bloody tuesday 
 
 bright are the stars that shine 
 dark is the sky 
 i know you never even try, girl
