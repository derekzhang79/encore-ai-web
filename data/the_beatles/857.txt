 watch to your fears 
 
 i'm the lonely one, as lonely as can be 
 you're going to know and i love her a lot 
 i can't believe that she'll ever ever go 
 not when she hugs and says she loves me early in the morning 
 lift my head, i'm still yawning 
 when i'm in the middle of the celebrations 
 i break down 
 
 don't be cold as ice 
 i said i'm trav'ling on the one 
 a could never die 
 as long as i 
 you're all to much for me to take 
 from the home i nearly made it 
 sitting on the sofa with a sister or loves you 
 you know i want you 
 oh i love you 
 i'd love to you and i want you so bad 
 all i do 
 and if i could forget her, but i can (ooh) 
 she does for me, yeah 
 and you know you should be glad 
 with a love like that 
 you don't get me, you don't get me 
 
 you don't regret a single day
