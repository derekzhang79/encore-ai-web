 everybody down and day 
 
 well, you know it's wrong 
 keep a crying, waiting, hoping you'll come back 
 i just can't seem to get you off my mind 
 blue mist round my mind when i'm in the middle of investigation 
 let me take you down, cause i'm going to make her mine, 
 you ought to know 
 then so the wife called his dreams to see 
 that you treat her number 
 love you all the time 
 
 hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me tight 
 let me take you down, 'cause i'm going to strawberry fields 
 nothing is real and nothing is real and nothing to get hung about 
 strawberry fields forever 
 
 cranberry sauce look at you all see the sea
