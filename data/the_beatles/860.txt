 bang, bang, maxwell's silver hammer 
 any way you'll never know, the many ways i've tried 
 and still they lead me back, to the long winding road 
 you left me standing here a long long long time ago 
 your mother should know (...know) 
 your mother should know your mother should... 
 your mother should know (...know) 
 your mother was born 
 though she thought i knew you, what did i know? 
 you don't leave me 
 don't bother me 
 
 i don't want to cry when there's people there 
 i get shy when they start to stare 
 i'm back in the u.s.s.r. 
 
 ha ha ha, 
 
 you make me dizzy, dizzy lizzy 
 oh i find that something 
 i wanna hold your hand 
 i wanna hold your hand 
 i wanna hold your hand 
 
 and when i ask you to be mine 
 
 keep your hands keep your hands keep your hands keep your hands keep your hands keep your hands off my baby 
 clarabella 
 yeah, yeah baby i'm changed 
 my misery la la la la
