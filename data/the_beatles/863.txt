 with love from us to you 
 
 i've known that from the life that you won't leave me no more 
 the love you take 
 is equal to the love 
 to you 
 i want you so bad 
 i want you 
 i want you to be my bride 
 run and tell your mama 
 i want you to do 
 is just hold me, hold me 
 tighter 
 
 number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9 
 
 who's gonna be a time 
 when i'm in the middle of a dream 
 stay in bed, float up stream float up stream 
 
 please don't be long 
 please please help my way 
 
 just one more thing, girl 
 you give back your hand 
 turn our face 
 
 and everybody can't go on anymore 
 
 please believe me when i tell you 
 i'm so glad that it's so hard to reason 
 
 don't stop and say hello 
 
 i say you will when you won't, ah ah, honey, don't 
 
 well i
