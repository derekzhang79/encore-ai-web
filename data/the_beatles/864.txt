 all day long i'm sitting singing songs for a girl like what i'm been in love 
 
 and now she sucks her thumb and wanders 
 by the door 
 and the night you don't come my way 
 
 many times i've been alone, and many times i've cried 
 any way you'll never know, the many ways i've tried before to you 
 gonna be no sad tomorrow 
 don't you know it's gonna be alright 
 don't you know my name 
 ba ba ba day 
 looking day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine 
 good day sunshine, good day sunshine 
 good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine 
 good day sunshine, good day sunshine 
 good day sunshine, good day sunshine 
 good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine 
 good day sunshine, good day
