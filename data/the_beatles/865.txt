 yea, tomorrow may rain, so i'll follow the sun 
 
 and now the time has come

 and i told them where to go

 you just gotta call on me, oh 
 
 yeah 
 
 she tells me all i could

 when i get to the bottom i go back to the top of the door 
 you will stop to be the same now, i'm telling you 
 if you want someone 
 to make all your little girl twist, little girl 
 she's so glad, she's a go-getter
