 i'm gonna sit right down and cry over you 
 i'm gonna sit right down and cry over you

 once, there was a way to get back homeward 
 once, there was a way to get back homeward 
 once, there was a way to get back home 
 sleep, pretty darling, do not cry 
 and i will sing a lullaby 
 
 once, there was a way to get back homeward 
 once, there was a way to get back home 
 sleep, pretty darling, do do do do
