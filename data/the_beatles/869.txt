 i'm looking through you, where did you go? 
 i thought i knew you, what did i know? 
 you don't look different, but you have always been my inspiration 
 please 
 remember i'll always be true 
 so please, love me do 
 whoa, oh, love me do 
 whoa, love me do 
 yeah, love me do 
 
 someone to love 
 someone like you 
 
 because it is so short 
 a business deal falls through 
 i informed him on the third night 
 good night, sleep tight 
 now the moon begins to shine 
 good night, sleep tight 
 now the moon begins to shine 
 good night, sleep tight 
 dream sweet dreams for you 
 
 mmmmmm 
 mmmmmm 
 mmmmmmmmmm 
 
 close your eyes and i'll close mine 
 good night, sleep tight 
 now the moon begins to shine 
 good night, sleep tight 
 dream sweet dreams for me dream sweet 
 dream sweet dreams for me dream sweet 
 if i had some more time to spend 
 then i guess i'd be with you my friend 
 if i needed someone
