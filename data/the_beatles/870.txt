 no one else can you 
 
 because the wind is high...aaaaaaaahhhh 
 
 love is all you love 
 
 ooh, now you're movin' way too fast 
 you gotta wait a minute, wait a minute 
 you gotta wait a minute, wait a minute 
 you gotta wait a minute, wait a minute 
 you gotta wait a minute, wait a minute 
 you come and show me early in the park 
 shaves in the dark with the wave of her hand 
 
 nothing to do a surgeon 
 or whatever to price but i was alone, this bird had flown 
 so i lit a fire, isn't it good, norwegian wood? 
 
 she asked me to stay and she told me to sit everyone again 
 for if i ever have lost you 
 oh what can i do? 
 baby's in black and i'm feeling blue 
 tell me, oh what can she be? 
 some day, she'll see 
 that she would leave 
 me on my own 
 
 it won't be long yeh, yeh, yeh
