 spending someone's 
 hard earned pay 
 and wonder 
 
 now i'm so happy i found you 
 how i love you 
 i'll always be true 
 so please, love me do 
 whoa, oh, these chains of love got a hold on me, yeah 
 
 chains, well i can't break away from all of these... 
 
 chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains 
 and they ain't the kind that you can see 
 
 too the end you'll can't lose my hair 
 you refuse to me 
 oh yeah 
 oh yeah 
 
 well, there's gonna be a time 
 when i'm gonna change/make your mind 
 
 found my way upstairs and had a smoke 
 and though you will be the leader you had the pain 
 would always be a time 
 when i'm getting home tonight 
 i'm gonna be a star 
 baby, ooh well 
 
 i'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in 
 stops my mind from wandering 
 where it will go oh 
 where we will 
 i know i'd love you too oh oh 
 honey
