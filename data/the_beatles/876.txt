 or back on the ground 
 seems so low and so near 
 i'm sure to fall in love with you 
 and all i gotta do 
 just call on us and we'll send it along 
 with love from us to you 
 
 then there was a way to get back homeward 
 once, there was a way to get back home 
 sleep, pretty darling, do not cry 
 and i will sing a lullaby 
 
 once, there was a way to get back home 
 sleep, pretty darling, do not cry 
 and i will sing a lullaby 
 
 once, there was a way to get back homeward 
 once, there was a way to get back homeward 
 once, there was a way to get back homeward 
 once, there was a way to get back homeward 
 once, there was a way to get back home 
 sleep, pretty darling, do not cry 
 and i hope you'll come out 
 i look about you 
 if i needed someone 
 
 something in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies 
 bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
