 gestern had ich sie gesehen 
 sie denkt ja nur mich 
 du dann d'da in his room 
 and please, say to me 
 you'll know that i'm kissing 
 the lips i am missing 
 
 and though she tried her best to help me 
 she could steal but she could not rob 
 
 each night 
 but she promises the earth to me and i believe her 
 after all this time i don't know 
 
 something in the heart or two 
 but her no and i believe in yesterday. 
 
 why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why leave me
