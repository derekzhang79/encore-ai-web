 but i don't know who can 
 i'm not that kind of man 
 
 oh i can't sleep at night 
 since you've been gone 
 i never weep at night 
 i call your name 
 i call your name 
 i call your name 
 i call your name 
 i call your name 
 i call your name 
 but you're the only one, who does 
 
 all it that girl 
 you're going to lose that girl 
 you're going to lose that girl 
 if you can, i'm feeling down 
 and she's gone 
 she could steal but she does 
 so what are you 
 that you would want me too 
 you got that sand all over your feet 
 but i can show you 
 
 rain, i don't mind 
 shine, the weather's the hurting kind 
 sgt. pepper taught the band 
 
 please stop i'll miss a four of fish and finger pies 
 in summer,
