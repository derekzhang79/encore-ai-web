 there'll be no sad 
 cos you like me too much and i like you 
 
 i don't want to cry 
 and i'd ask my friends to come and see 
 an octopus's garden in the shade 
 late of pablo fanques fair, what a scene! 
 
 over men and horses hoops and garters 
 lastly through a hogshead of real fire! 
 in this way mr. k. will challenge the world! 
 
 the celebrated mr. k. 
 performs his feat on saturday at bishopsgate 
 
 hey bulldog! hey bulldog! hey bulldog! 
 hey bulldog! hey bulldog! 
 
 hey bulldog! hey bulldog! hey bulldog! 
 hey bulldog! hey bulldog! hey bulldog! 
 
 [hey in the " 
 yes you could say that i've been unhappy with you 
 but, as from today, well, i've seen somebody that's new 
 i ain't no fool and i don't take what i don't just don't treat you 
 but you'll have to take but she don't care 
 there's no fun in what i do if she's looking lonely 
 where do they come on come on come on come on come on
