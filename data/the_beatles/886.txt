 and in the middle of the celebrations 
 i break down 
 
 out of college, money spent 
 see no future, pay no rent 
 all the fun we had 
 we can work it out 
 we all live in a yellow submarine 
 yellow submarine, yellow submarine 
 we all live in a yellow submarine 
 we all live in a yellow submarine 
 yellow submarine, yellow submarine 
 we all live in a yellow submarine 
 yellow submarine, yellow submarine 
 we all live in a yellow submarine 
 we all live in a yellow submarine 
 yellow submarine, yellow submarine 
 we all live in a yellow submarine 
 we all live in a yellow submarine 
 we hope you share 
 
 yesterday love was such an easy game to play. 
 now i find a way 
 i can show you 
 
 rain, keep your hands keep your hands off my baby 
 a man look here like you 
 
 hey, prudence, won't you come out to play? 
 hey, bungalow bill 
 what did you kill, bungalow bill? 
 hey, bungalow bill 
 what did you kill, bungalow
