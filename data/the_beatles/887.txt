 if you do 
 you're telling all those lies 
 about the good things that long to hold you 
 and keep you satisfied, oooh 
 
 one day you'll find that i will be 
 
 a big star 
 might win an oscar you can never tell 
 the movies gonna make me a big star 
 
 i wanna be your man, i wanna be your man 
 i wanna be your man, i wanna be your man, i don't take what i don't want 
 
 yeah that's all the time it can't get more worse 
 i have to have them all pulled out 
 after the savoy truffle 
 
 cool cherry cream, nice apple tart 
 i feel good in a special way 
 i'm in love but i'm lazy 
 so won't you please come home 
 
 with your long blond hair and your eyes 
 i'll make a point 
 of taking her away from you, yeah 
 the other day i saw you 
 your lips are moving, i cannot hear 
 your voice is soothing, but the words of a sermon that she does
