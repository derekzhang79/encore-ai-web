 keep all my love is away? 
 does it told you 
 
 and now you've changed your mind 
 i love you so 
 
 because the wind is high...aaaaaaaahhhh 
 
 love is dead 
 you think she needs to see the plan 
 you find that all the thought of meeting the girl it's true 
 what it means to hold you tight 
 being here alone tonight with you 
 it's everything i need 
 before this dance is through 
 i think i'll love you too 
 
 because the sky is blue...aaaaaaaahhhh 
 
 aaaaahhhhhhhhhh... 
 aaaaahhhhhhhhhh... 
 aaaaahhhhhhhhhh... 
 
 of all the love i have won or have lost you 
 you made a time to say good night 
 we it will be a fool 
 on my head 
 look for the a tree 
 they don't know, they can't see, are you free 
 but he could play his guitar 
 just like a-ringing a bell 
 
 go please get the horn by the bull 
 ow! 
 
 too much a, too much a 
 too much a, too much a, too much a, too much
