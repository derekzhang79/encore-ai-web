 
 falling, yes i am falling 
 and she keeps calling 
 me and so she have lost you 
 when i loved you 
 
 it took a long long time 
 now i'm coming back home 
 i've been away now 
 oh how, i've been alone 
 
 wait till i come back to your side 
 i might and they're safe 
 happy and they're safe 
 happy and they're safe 
 happy and they're safe 
 happy and you can get my way 
 i'll pray and pray more each day 
 cos we love you, mr. moonlight 
 molly lets the children lend a hand arm! leg! 
 molly stays at home and does her pretty face 
 and in the evening she's a singer with the band 
 
 she's going to change her mind 
 and so not it still 
 
 while you see it your way 
 what did i know? 
 you don't look different, but you have changed 
 i'm looking through you, and you're nowhere 
 
 why, tell the time from his special cup, doctor robert 
 doctor robert, you're a ihr baby 
 baby
