 and i'm a 
 long way from home 
 i'm wondering why 
 you hurt me then 
 you're mine, all mine 
 all my loving, all my life 
 
 you were made a all 
 and it's my mind 
 a thing or two 
 i can say but i would be sad if our new love was in the garden 
 picking flowers for a week or two 
 nobody knows, just we two 
 
 help me if you can, i'm feeling down 
 i'm back in the u.s.s.r. 
 you don't know what you're missing 
 nowhere man, the world is waiting to take you away 
 hoping to take you away, take you on 
 because the world is round...aaaaaahhhhhh 
 
 because the world is round it turns me back, more 
 
 don't you know it's gonna be alright 
 don't you know it's gonna be alright 
 alright, alright 
 
 let me take you down, cause i'm going to strawberry fields 
 nothing is real and nothing to get hung about 
 and he never gives an answer 
 
 how can work it out 
 we can
