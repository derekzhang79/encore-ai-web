 love is all you need 
 love is all you need 
 love is all you need 
 love is all you need 
 love is only love 
 
 there's nothing to say but it's so hard loving you 
 
 in your sweaty hands 
 some kind of solitude is measured out in you 
 you think you got to be free 
 
 blackbird fly 
 blackbird fly 
 into the light of the dark black night. 
 
 blackbird singing better baby, now 
 
 went out last yeh 
 it used to carry you away 
 if you drive a car, i'll tax the heat 
 if you take a walk, i'll tax your feet 
 
 taxman! 
 cos i'm the taxman, yeah, i'm the taxman 
 
 julia, julia, oceanchild, calls me 
 so i do, and it's true. 
 don't want nobody, nobody, 'cause baby, it's you. sha la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la 
 
 don't leave me chances 
 you and i have memories 
 longer than the road that stretches out ahead
