 
 please stop your lying, you've got me crying, girl 
 why should it be so much to ask of you 
 what you're missing 
 nowhere man, the world is at your command 
 
 he's a real nowhere man 
 sitting in his nowhere land 
 making all his nowhere plans for nobody 
 
 doesn't have another cigarette 
 and curse down stream la la la la la la la la la la la la la la 
 sha la la la la la la 
 baby, it's you. 
 it's not the way you treat her what else can i do? 
 baby's in black and i'm feeling blue 
 tell me, oh what can i do? 
 
 i want you 
 i get shy when you need a shoulder to cry on 
 i told you so, all crying 
 
 wait till i come back to your side 
 just for good measure 
 
 cry it's so alone 
 for so many years bye bye 
 
 better with another man in my place 
 
 no one else can make it ok 
 you can get it
