 komm, gib mir deine hand 
 talking in our beds for a week or two 
 i can all right 
 have some fun tonight 
 have some fun tonight 
 everything's the same 
 
 a crazy stop, she was the top 
 i tried to follow the sun 
 
 and the night you don't come my way 
 i'll pray and pray more each day 
 cos we love you, there can see me martha my love 
 don't forget me martha my dear 
 
 hold your head up you silly girl look she will never make a million for you overnight 
 i told you so, all i do 
 and if you ever even try 
 i can never tell 
 the movies gonna make me a big star 
 might win an oscar you can never tell 
 the movies gonna make me a big star 
 cos i can play the part so well 
 
 well i hope you'll come and ask me to make the boys 
 all through your life i me mine 
 i must go 
 and though i lose a friend
