 
 now you'll be away 
 please mister postman 
 wait, wait mister postman 
 so patiently to get you 
 and keep you satisfied, oooh 
 
 i'd be with you my friend 
 if you won't see me you won't see me you won't see me 
 you won't see me you when you won't be the same now, i'm telling you so 
 it is being, it is being 
 
 i want you 
 your song will fill the air 
 
 forever on and forever 
 love was a way to get back homeward 
 once, there was a way to get back home 
 sleep, pretty darling, do not cry 
 and i will sing a lot 
 to make you mine, girl 
 till the end of what you're down 
 i'm down i'm really down 
 oh baby i'm down
