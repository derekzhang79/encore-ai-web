 
 no one can succeed like doctor robert 
 
 well, well, well, you're feeling fine 
 
 well, i could speak my mind and tell you your dreams 
 tonight? 
 
 [drum solo] 
 
 [guitar solos] 
 
 and in the mood they gave me your answer, fill in a form 
 on the mantel shelf 
 see the hands are busy 
 working overtime 
 a soap impression 
 they gave me how you feel 
 tell the truth now, tell me it's the institution 
 i said these words to my girl 
 i know you never get tired i'll tax your seat 
 if you know i love baby 
 that's what i want that's what i want that's what i said tonight 
 for red is the color that i left you 
 so, come on back and see just what you would do 
 
 happiness not a second time 
 not the second time 
 
 i want you 
 a thing or two about our love 
 that do me let me see you smile again 
 dear prudence, won't you let me see you smile again 
 dear
