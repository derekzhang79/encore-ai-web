 
 from if from my hands you're miles away 
 and nobody ever hears him 
 someday you will be a man 
 and you will be the leader 
 of every head he's had the pleasure to know 
 and if the rhythm finally gets you and the beat gets you too 
 and i held her hand in mine... 
 
 lay down your mother was born 
 lived a man must break his back to london 
 see how they run 
 
 lady madonna, children at your feet 
 wonder how you manage to make ends meet 
 she's leaving home after getting dark 
 so hard to sea 
 
 whoa-i, whoa-i 
 i've got a whole lot of things to tell her 
 don't you know it's gonna be alright 
 don't you know that it's so 
 there'll be no sad 
 so i looked up to see i've gone 
 
 i can't mind 
 i'd give you all i got to do 
 is call you on my bended knees 
 you're coming home 
 
 so i sing
