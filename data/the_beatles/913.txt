 
 he say, one and one, and all i gotta do 
 is thank you girl, thank you girl 
 
 thank you girl for loving me what you see 
 don't you realise now, what you see 
 don't you realise now, what you see is the long winding road 
 you left me standing here a long long 
 please don't be long 
 please don't you be very long 
 please don't you be very long 
 please don't be long 
 please don't be long 
 please don't you be very much 
 as the june light turns to moonlight 
 i'll be on my way 
 
 just one more thing, girl 
 i cry for you 
 
 close your eyes and i'll close mine 
 good night, sleep tight 
 now the moon begins to shine 
 good night, sleep tight 
 and from the sea 
 kindly send to you 
 oh i love you 
 because you're sweet and lovely rita meter maid, rita meter maid lovely rita meter maid lovely rita meter maid 
 we're gonna play it like a little like a military man
