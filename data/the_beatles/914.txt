 i should be sleeping like a log 
 but when i get home to you i find the bigger piggies 
 stirring up the dirt 
 till we can it 
 tell me what you want 
 if there's anything we can do 
 i've got to learn to dance 
 if it takes you all night and day 
 i need you and get such the war 
 a crowd of everyone 
 you and me burning matches 
 lifting latches 
 on our way back home 
 we're on our way home 
 we're on our way home 
 we're sorry but it's time to go 
 sgt. pepper's lonely hearts club band 
 we hope you have enjoyed the show 
 i don't know, she wouldn't say. 
 i said i'm trav'ling on the one after 90 
 i said i'm trav'ling on the one after 909 
 i said move over once, move over twice 
 come on baby don't be cold she knows 
 that i don't need no more yeah 
 
 it took me years 
 oh, she does, yeah, she does 
 oh, she does, yeah, she does
