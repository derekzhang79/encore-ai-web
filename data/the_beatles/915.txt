 she's got a lovely audience 
 we'd like to take you home with us 
 we'd love to take you away 
 from the very start 
 that you would be late 
 about an hour or two 
 to say about the things that you do 
 will make a dove-tail joint, yeah 
 looking through a glass onion 
 
 oh i say hello 
 hello goodbye hello goodbye hello hello 
 hello goodbye hello goodbye hello hello hello 
 
 ever leave me one more time, how can i get through? 
 can't buy me love

 can't buy me love is real 
 words of love you whisper soft and true 
 darling i love you 
 
 let me hear you smile? 
 
 dear prudence, won't you let me standing here, a long long time 
 since i heard from that girl of mine 
 getting so much better all the time
