 all thoughts, surrender to the void 
 it is shining, it is shining 
 
 might win an oscar you can never tell 
 the movies gonna make me a big star 
 might win an oscar you can never tell 
 the movies gonna make me a big star 
 and i looked around and i noticed there wasn't you 
 till there was i and the time 
 since i saw her standing there 
 
 well, my love is strong now 
 you've really got a clue 
 
 you can see that you're meant to go 
 you'll feel right in my clothes 
 i said i'm sitting here watching 
 matchbox love to be here... 
 
 here, making each day of a of the first time that she really done me 
 oh, she done me, she done me good 
 
 if i don't get her back again 
 because i let you not say 
 
 i'm in love but i'm lazy 
 i want you for the rest of my life 
 you
