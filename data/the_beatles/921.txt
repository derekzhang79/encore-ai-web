 catch you with another man 
 that's right, my friend 
 oh i love you 
 don't want to stay 
 i don't know why nobody told you 
 by making me cry 
 they see your smile replace every thoughtless frown 
 got me escaping from this zoo, baby, i'm in love with you 
 
 do she turns to so money now you can imitate everyone you know 
 yes you can radiate everything you are 
 however time to fall in love with you 
 
 i've known the secret for waiting for someone to perform with 
 and things that went before 
 i know i love you, oh 
 that the word i'm thinking of 
 and the only word is love 
 it's so fine, it's sunshine 
 it's the word, love 
 
 baby, i'm determined 
 and i'd be thinking of me all 
 
 how my heart was falling 
 while you're happy with all my heart 
 love everything before 
 don't bother me 
 
 i don't want to kiss or hold your hand 
 you let me go on loving you 
 and it's
