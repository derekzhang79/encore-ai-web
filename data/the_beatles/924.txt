 well you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag 
 yes you can imitate everyone you know my number four 
 oh you know my name and he bag feel she has to hurry 
 she no longer needs you 
 
 hold on, i can go 
 and though i lose a friend 
 in the evening go 'round 
 the queen was in the playroom 
 painting pictures for the childrens holiday 
 
 ah, look at all the lonely people ah, look at all the lonely people 
 where do they all come from? 
 all the lonely people 
 ah, look at all the lonely people 
 where do they all come from? 
 all the lonely people 
 where do they all belong? 
 
 all of my life of trouble 
 mother mary comes to see me cry 
 and i will sing a lullaby 
 
 golden slumbers fill your eyes 
 cos i'm the kind of guy 
 who could ask for more? 
 will the wind that blew her boat 
 across the sea of within 
 it is knowing, it is knowing...
