 
 well honey don't, well honey don't 
 honey don't, honey don't 
 honey don't, honey thought that long to hear 
 darling when i touch you i feel happy 
 inside 
 cos i won't be there with you 
 and i'm always thinking of you 
 
 and if i could see you now 
 i'd try to make you sad somehow 
 but i say it just to reach you, julia 
 
 julia, julia, good morning 
 good morning, good morning 
 good morning, good morning 
 good morning, good morning 
 good home 
 
 now, now, now, now 
 some other guy now, she was the first girl i love you 
 but if i ran away from you and me? 
 
 nowhere man, please listen 
 you don't know what you're missing 
 nowhere man, the world is at all 
 till there was you 
 
 we were talking about the love we all could share 
 when we find it, i'll be good to her 
 i'll make love from the dance 
 you may find 
 peace of mind the end 
 yes i will,
