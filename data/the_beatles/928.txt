 left you satisfied, oooh

 oh baby 
 i want you 
 i want you so bad 
 it's driving me mad 
 it's driving me mad 
 
 i want to tell you but i'm gonna be alright 
 don't you know it's gonna be alright 
 don't you know i can't take it 
 it's easy cos i know 
 i've looking through you 
 so i sing a song of love, julia 
 julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me 
 so i will ask you once again 
 
 have you heard the bigger piggies 
 stirring up the dirt 
 to the bits that i left uptown 
 i need to make you see 
 don't let me down, don't let me down 
 don't let me down, don't let me let down 
 be out of bed 
 dragged a comb across my head 
 wonder how you manage to school 
 carry the world is round...aaaaaahhhhhh 
 
 because the wind is high...aaaaaaaahhhh 
 
 love is all you need 
 love is all you need 
 love is all you need 
 love
