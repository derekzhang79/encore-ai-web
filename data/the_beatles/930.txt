 i'm down i'm really down 
 i'm down down on the ground i'm really down 
 well baby i'm down i'm really down 
 how can you laugh when you know i'm down 
 how can you laugh when you know i'm down 
 oh baby you can drive my car 
 yes i'm gonna be a star 
 baby you don't really you have to go 
 sgt. pepper's lonely, sgt. pepper's lonely 
 sgt. pepper's lonely hearts club band 
 it's getting very near the end 
 sgt. pepper taught the band to play 
 they've been going in and grinning a grin 
 he got joo-joo eyeball, he was saying, and his voice is soothing, but the old 
 he said i'm sitting here wondering 
 matchbox hole in my clothes 
 i ain't no fool and i don't care 
 there's no fun in what i do if she's not there 
 i wonder what it's like to listen to your fears 
 
 i can't believe 
 she's gonna tear your heart apart 
 oh boy, when you're dead 
 you don't come my way 
 i'll pray
