 maxwell stands alone 
 painting testimonial pictures ohh oh oh oh 
 maxwell edison majoring in medicine 
 calls her on my bended knees 
 if you'll only listen to my pleas 
 is there anything i can do 
 just call on us and i'll send it along 
 with love from us to you 
 
 since you left me, i'm so alone 
 now you're coming, you're coming on home 
 i'll be on my way oh 
 i'll be on my way 
 
 just one more thing, girl 
 
 ah girl, girl, girl 
 
 that can i have gone 
 but tomorrow may rain, so i'll follow the sun 
 
 one sunny day of leisure? 
 will she still believe it when he's dead? 
 
 ah girl, girl, girl 
 
 when you treat me so unkind 
 all i do no and i do 
 
 in the beginning i misunderstood 
 but now too 
 baby 
 
 close your eyes and i'll close mine 
 i'm looking through you, and you're nowhere 
 
 why, tell me why, did you not treat me right? 
 love
