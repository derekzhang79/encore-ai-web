 put your little hand in mine 
 oh yeah

 you'll make me a big star 
 cos i can play the part so well

 don't want to wait the world 
 a number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number

 and the night you don't come my way 
 keep i rain again
