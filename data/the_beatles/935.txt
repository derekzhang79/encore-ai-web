 dark is the sky 
 i know what i trust there 
 
 i can't sleep at me 
 cos i'm the taxman, yeah, i'm the taxman 
 
 should five per cent appear too small 
 i'm looking through you, and you're nowhere 
 
 why, tell me why, did you not treat me right? 
 love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight 
 
 happiness is a warm gun, mama happiness bang, bang, shoot, shoot 
 happiness is a warm gun, mama happiness bang, bang, shoot, shoot 
 happiness is a warm gun, mama happiness bang, bang, shoot, shoot 
 and molly says this as she takes him on the third night 
 he got monkey finger, he shoot coca-cola 
 he say, one and one, and she ever thought he was a loner 
 but he knew it wouldn't last 
 jojo left his home with you 
 it's not my mind 
 that you would want me too 
 you know i'd give you everything i've got 
 for a number of things 
 that weren't important yesterday
