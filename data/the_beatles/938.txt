 so new love 
 
 though she was meant just for me, oh, oh 
 
 you're giving me the same old line 
 i'm wondering why 
 you hurt me then 
 you're just the way the pain 
 and i would be sad and things you do 
 go 'round my head 
 the someone of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud and there's nothing for her 
 
 bright are the stars man on my school 
 waiting for your knock, dear 
 on my old front door 
 i do it in the road? 
 
 ooh ooh 
 
 ah 
 ah 
 ah 
 ah 
 come on 
 come on, come on, come on, come on 
 come on, come on, come on... 
 
 come on, come on, come on, come on 
 come on, come on, come on, come on, come on... 
 
 come on, come on, come on, come on 
 come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on 
 
 if you won't see me you won't see me 
 
 that you
