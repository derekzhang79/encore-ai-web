 too many tires 
 wipe the windows 
 check the tire 
 check the oil and all the gas 
 ow! 
 
 some other guy now, is sippin' up the honey like a yellow dog, oh yeah 
 
 oh yeah 
 
 oh yeah 
 
 oh yeah 
 all i got to do 
 i've got to go, i don't know, she wouldn't say. 
 i said that's oh so long 
 bye, bye, bye, bye 
 
 you don't understand what i " 
 i said, no, no, no, you're wrong. 
 when i feel blue 
 and it's my mind 
 we do the stroll 
 come on, miss lizzy 
 love me before i grow too old 
 
 i used to be cruel to my woman 
 i beat her and kept her apart from the things that she hoped would say more 
 she doesn't have a lot to say 
 but it's so hard loving you 
 
 is it right that you and me were meant to know 
 that i've been alone 
 
 wait till i come back to your side 
 we'll forget the tears
