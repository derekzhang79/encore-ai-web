 
 i came along to turn on everyone 
 sexy sadie oooh you broke the rules 
 
 don't want nobody, baby 
 keep your hands keep your hands keep your hands keep your hands off my baby don't care 
 
 my baby don't care, my baby don't care 
 my know that you have in mind 
 and your bird can sing 
 but you left me sitting on my own 
 
 i'll take you out to the pictures, joan? 
 but as you are bound to each other by love 
 to each other by love 
 
 whoever knew that we too could be free as we fancied 
 fancy is free but we are who are bound to each other by love 
 
 whoever knew that we too could be free as we fancied 
 fancy is free but we are all together 
 see how they fly 
 into the light of within 
 she goes up and married 
 but i love you still
