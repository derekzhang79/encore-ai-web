 i couldn't stop myself from calling 
 well look a-there, look a-there 
 wow look out. 
 
 she told me she worked in the morning on the mantel shelf 
 see the hands you see. 
 [brian:] yes, a point, but your bird can swing 
 but i can't break away from all of these... 
 
 chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains 
 and they ain't the kind that you know 
 she tells me all the time, you know 
 she said so 
 i'm in love with you 
 and what it is not dying 
 
 lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void 
 it is shining, it is shining 
 
 yet the sun shines down 
 and sip their lemonade 
 when the sun shines 
 
 rain, i don't mind 
 shine, the weather's fine 
 
 i do all the pleasing to you, the choice. we think you're fab and really cool, so brighten up our lads at " dig this, for here's paul, whistling clarabella". 
 don't you know that it's so 
 
 ah as good as i can be 
 and
