 
 i want you 
 you know i love you 
 your know that i makes 
 
 i'd love to turn you on 
 
 woke up, fell out of bed 
 dragged a comb across my head 
 wonder where you are tonight 
 and if you take a walk, i'll tax your feet 
 yeah i'm the taxman 
 
 don't ask me what i want it for aahh mr. wilson 
 if you don't want my peaches honey 
 please don't be like me 
 
 and till you've been 
 i wonder and i too play guitar, sometimes i play the fool... 
 when the rain comes down 
 everything's the same 
 when the sun shines 
 
 rain, i don't mind 
 i could wait forever, i've got time 
 
 sometimes i wish i knew you are 
 yes you can radiate everything you are

 why don't we do it in the road? mm 
 why don't we do it, do it in the road? 
 
 ooh 
 
 come together right
