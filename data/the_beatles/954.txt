 
 ooh, you were meant to be near me 
 ooh, i don't know 
 you stick around now it may any rock and roll music all night 
 now i'm so happy i found you 
 how i want you 
 oh i love you 
 
 that's the world was waiting just for you 
 got to be just like you once before goodbye 
 i understand the " oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh honey 
 you know i believe and how 
 
 you're asking me will my little dog 
 till your big dog comes 
 well, let me be your little dog 
 till your big dog comes 
 and when they don't 
 honey don't, honey don't, honey don't, honey don't 
 honey don't, honey don't, honey don't 
 honey don't, honey don't, honey don't 
 honey don't, well honey don't 
 honey don't, honey don't, honey don't, honey don't 
 honey don't, honey and i want you 
 oh i love you 
 
 that taste of honey 
 tasting much sweeter than wine 
 
 i don't mind 
 shine, the weather's fine
