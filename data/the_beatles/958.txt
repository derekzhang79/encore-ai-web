 
 please stop so many tears i was searching 
 so many time at the queen 
 only place that he's ever been 
 and i held her hand in mine... 
 
 whoah, that's the way it's gotta be (ooh) 
 it's not the way you treat her what else can i do? 
 i love you 
 every single day? 
 he could only billy shears 
 and sgt. pepper's lonely hearts club band 
 we hope you have found her, now today 
 nah nah nah 
 
 can you 
 you treat me badly 
 i love you more oh oh oh 
 honey pie, honey pie you are making me crazy 
 i'm in love with her and i will try to show 
 there's nothing for me here so i will disappear 
 if you don't take her out tonight 
 making love to only you 
 i turn and for a gun 
 so that's a 
 
 she thinks of him and so she dresses in the morning 
 sgt. pepper's lonely hearts club band 
 it's getting very near the end 
 through thick and thin
