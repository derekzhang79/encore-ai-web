 mm i and me 
 no one there were another little mich 
 feel like a man

 yeah yeah yeah 
 
 well, there's gonna be a time 
 when i'm gonna change/make your mind 
 so keep every rock and roll music all night 
 well, he got toe-jam football my guitar gently weeps 
 
 well... 
 
 i love you, honey pie you are making me crazy 
 i'm in love with you 
 many, that ignorance and hates may mourn the dead 
 if the rain comes, if the rain comes 
 like this, da-da-n'da-da'n'da 
 
 falling, yes i am falling 
 and she keeps calling 
 me on my bended knees 
 if you'll only listen to the sound of music, 
 and she promises the earth to me and i want you 
 oh i love you 
 
 let me hear you say the words i long to hear 
 darling when i do i know if you break on you 
 oh yeah 
 all i can hear, i me bad
