 for a week 
 the newspapers said, she's gone to his head 
 see the hands are ticking 
 on the mantel shelf 
 see the hands are busy 
 working overtime 
 a soap impression of his wife which he ate 
 and donated to the national health, doctor robert 
 doctor robert, you're a new and better man 
 he helps you to understand 
 he does everything he can, doctor robert 
 
 if you'll only listen to my pleas 
 
 let me tell you how it will be 
 there's a shadow hanging over me. 
 oh, yesterday came suddenly. 
 
 why she was the kiss that awoke my heart 
 there lingers still, though we're far apart 
 
 that taste of day 
 
 i love you and all i want you to do 
 
 he never ever learned 
 to read or write a book so please you 
 
 i don't wanna sound complaining 
 but you can't see me, you can't see me 
 
 when your prized possessions start to weigh you down 
 look in my direction, i'll be 'round, i'll be 'round
