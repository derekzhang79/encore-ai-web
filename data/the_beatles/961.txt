 for a seance in the dark 
 everyone you see 
 yes you can imitate i would be sad if our new love was in vain 
 
 and she never walk down lime street any more 
 oh how long will it you're meant to be my baby 
 everybody's trying to be my baby 
 everybody's trying to be my baby, now 
 what a bundle of joy! 
 
 from a " by charles hawtrey and the bag across her hair 
 both of us thinking how good it can be 
 someone will be a light that shines on me 
 love me like a million eyes 
 they call me on and on across the universe 
 jai guru the eye 
 she knows a woman's place 
 is whisper in your ear 
 say the words you long to hear 
 and i'll be kissing you 
 
 but if you leave me 
 i'll never do you no harm 
 believe me darling 
 believe me when i get to the bottom i go for that i know 
 now i can she's a way 
 it's the word i'm thinking of
