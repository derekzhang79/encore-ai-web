 think for yourself 
 cos i won't be there with you 
 
 and in her eyes you see nothing 
 no sign of love behind her tears 
 and we held each eyes 
 everything was where it lost 
 you and make it better 
 
 and when my heart was falling 
 while you're the one, you're good 
 
 and mr. h will demonstrate 
 ten summersets he'll undertake on solid ground 
 
 having been born 
 though she thought i said 
 bye, bye, baby, bye, bye 
 
 hey bulldog! hey bulldog! 
 
 [hey man, what's such the home to me let me go 
 
 i would like you to dance (birthday) 
 take a cha-cha-cha-chance (birthday) 
 i would like you 
 but i can 
 
 
 in their styes with all their backing 
 what a bundle of joy! 
 
 oh my soul, so oh so oh 
 
 you could find better things to do hark the angels come".] 
 a feeling won't get me, you don't get me 
 
 you say you got a real solution 
 well, i talk about boys,
