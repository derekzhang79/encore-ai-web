 
 i don't need to hug or hold you tight 
 i got my bag, run to the station 
 railman says you've got the the wrong location 
 i got so many there to meet 
 
 dear prudence, won't you let me see you smile? 
 
 child-like 
 why would she long down 
 
 at twelve o'clock a meeting round the table 
 for a seance in the dark 
 with voices out of nowhere 
 put a shot of rhythm and blues 
 with just a little child 
 little child, won't you come out 
 
 it won't be the same now, i'm telling you so 
 you'll understand 
 
 michelle, ma belle 
 sont des mots qui vont très bien ensemble 
 très bien ensemble 
 
 i said i'm sitting here wondering a i-i-me-me-mine, 
 come on let's take a real solution 
 well, you know i need someone, help 
 
 when you've seen beyond yourself then you may find that girl 
 i told you so, all i can hear, i me mine 
 all i gotta do 
 is thank you girl, thank you girl for loving
