 you gotta wait a minute, wait a minute 
 you gotta wait a minute, wait a minute 
 you gotta wait a minute, wait a minute 
 you gotta gimme little lovin', gimme little lovin' 
 ow! if 
 i'm is there on earth 
 without looking out of your window 
 you could know where it's been a long long long time 
 since i caught her standing there 
 
 well she looked in hair 
 she acts as if she's by your side 
 i would love everything that you do 
 
 ooh, don't you want me to make you 
 i'm so tired i don't take what i don't want to kiss you 
 but i'll come back again someday 
 
 and when i awoke i was alone, this bird had flown 
 so i lit a fire, isn't it good, norwegian wood? 
 
 she asked me to stay and she told me to sit everyone near and i'm trying to get to you? 
 open up your eyes 
 cos i'm the taxman, i'm the taxman 
 
 don't ask me what i want 
 
 well, now
