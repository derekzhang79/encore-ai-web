 the magical mystery tour! 
 step right this way!] 
 
 roll up, fell out of bed 
 dragged a comb across my head 
 then we'd lie beneath the shady tree 
 i love you 
 all my loving, all my loving i will send to you 
 
 all of my life 
 
 there ain't no reason for you all 
 now today 
 
 i'm talking to you baby 
 i'll never never die 
 and his hive your door 
 and she promises the earth to me and she told me like a million eyes 
 they call me on and on across the universe 
 jai guru the eye 
 she doesn't never be free 
 and i will take her out tonight 
 she's it on me 
 
 and all i gotta do 
 is call you on the phone 
 
 there's nothing i won't do you promise not to tell, whoa oh, oh 
 
 closer 
 let me whisper a boy comes mother's ha ha ha ha! 
 
 you've got it, that's great! that's right! that's it, let it be
