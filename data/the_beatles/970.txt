 go with him (anna) 
 go home 
 
 cry baby cry 
 make your mother sigh 
 she's old enough to know better 
 please don't be long 
 please don't you be very 
 she'll never hurt me 
 she won't desert me 
 she's an angel sent to me 
 
 well, i know that you will plainly see 
 the biggest fool that you like a well you will know, know 
 
 just had a long time 
 boy, you're going to carry that weight 
 carry that weight a long time 
 boy, you're going to carry that weight 
 carry that weight a long time 
 boy, you're going to carry that weight 
 carry that weight a long time 
 boy, you're going to carry that weight, 
 carry that weight a long time 
 now i'm coming back home 
 i've been away now 
 oh how, i've been like this 
 but you've got everything you want 
 if there's anything we can do 
 just call on us and he left it no doubt 
 
 can you hear me 
 leave me one more time, i hate
