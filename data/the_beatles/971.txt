 get back to where you once belonged 
 sing it again 
 da da da da... 
 
 listen to the pretty sound of music 
 play it to me, play it 
 coming to take you away, take you 
 but i am of the universe 
 pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind 
 possessing and please 
 
 number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9 
 
 who's too much a 
 too much a, too much a, too much a, too much a, too much a, too much a, too much a, too much a, too much a, too much a, too much a, too much a 
 too much a, too much a 
 
 much, much, much, much 
 much, much, much, much, much 
 much, much, much, much 
 
 lady madonna, baby at your breast 
 wonders how you manage to make ends meet 
 
 and when i ask you to be mine 
 i can't go on 
 holding back these tears in my little dreams
