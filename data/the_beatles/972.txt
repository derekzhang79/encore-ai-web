 for a little peace of mind 
 i see no reason to change mine 
 i cry it's through, oh 
 
 you're giving me the same old line 
 i'm wondering why 
 you hurt me then 
 i wanna be your man, i wanna be your man 
 i wanna be your man 
 love you like no other baby 
 i think you're fine 
 cos we love you, mr. moonlight 
 
 and now she sucks her thumb and wanders 
 by the banks of her own lagoon 
 
 didn't anybody as 
 you'll be older too 
 and if you ever even try 
 i can never win 
 hearing them, seeing them 
 in the good things that i've ever had 
 
 oh, ja sie liebt dich 
 schoner da da da... 
 though she tried her best to help me 
 you didn't need me anymore 
 well you know i love you 
 
 i've got to admit it's getting better since you've been mine 
 getting so much younger than today 
 i like the way you wear your clothes 
 everything about you is so doggone sweet
