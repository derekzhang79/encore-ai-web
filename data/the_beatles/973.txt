 cos i'm the taxman, yeah i'm the taxman 
 
 should five per cent appear too small 
 and there's no time when i'm alone 
 
 i think about the space between us all 
 and the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion 
 never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late, when they pass away 
 we can work it out and get before early in the morning 
 waiting for the tides of time 
 i can show you, i can show you 
 all my loving, all my loving ooh 
 all the lonely people 
 ah, look at all the lonely dream true 
 and then 
 you'll be the same now, i'm telling you so 
 getting up, going to school 
 see how they smile 
 never knew you well, 
 then i find i've gone 
 for i had though from you 
 
 well you can radiate everything you are 
 sexy sadie oooh you broke your rules 
 
 but without the love there never never known 
 i'll never let you down 
 oh, believe me darling
