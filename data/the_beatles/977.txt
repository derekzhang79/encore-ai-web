 
 i want you 
 i've changed my mind and opened up the doors 
 
 help me if you can, i'm feeling down 
 but now you got a boyfriend down the street 
 baby what they said 
 oh, some rotten deal 
 ow! 
 
 you've been dead 
 
 sit back and there's nothing doing 
 everything is closed it's like a ruin 
 everyone you see 
 
 she's so heavy 
 she's so heavy 
 that's what i want, whoo 
 whoah, yeah, i need you 
 oh, love me do 
 the love that's shining all around with you 
 
 i've known the secret 
 is a warm, yes it is, gun happiness bang, bang, shoot, shoot 
 happiness is a warm, yes it is, gun happiness bang, bang, shoot, shoot 
 when i was a boy everything was right, 
 everything was times 
 
 that taste and i way 
 now i'm too much in a room 
 
 in their eyes there's something lacking 
 what can i do? 
 
 i look at you all see the need 
 
 would love to love you
