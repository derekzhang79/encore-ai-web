 and the bag across her shoulder 
 made her look a little like a military man

 let me take you down, cause i'm going to strawberry fields 
 nothing is real and nothing 
 with every mistake we must surely be learning 
 still my guitar gently weeps 
 i don't know why 
 i don't mind 
 shine, the weather's fine 
 
 i can show you, i can show you 
 
 because the world is round...aaaaaahhhhhh
