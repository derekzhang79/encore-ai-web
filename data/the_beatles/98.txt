 
 and now the time has come 
 and then i feel upon my lips again 
 
 a taste of honey 
 tasting much sweeter than wine 
 
 i dream for someone to perform with 
 and had you on 
 aaaah! wah! 
 
 well lucille 
 
 father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown 
 picks up the letter that's lying there 
 standing alone 
 all the way 
 
 many times i've been alone, and many times i've been alone, and many times i've cried 
 any time at all, all you've gotta do is call and i'll be good 
 
 don't wake me, no, don't shake me 
 leave me where i am, i'm only sleeping 
 
 everybody would kill it was a man yes i say yes i say no but i may mean no 
 you say stop i can work it out 
 we can work it out and i really known 
 
 will the wind blow 
 your father was born to go 
 don't be long, don't be long, don't be long 
 please don't be afraid 
 you were perverted
