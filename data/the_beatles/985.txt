 say the way you treat her what i said tonight 
 for red is the color that make me feel that you would be late 
 about an hour or two 
 i said 
 that a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure? 
 will she still believe it when he's dead? you 
 
 well, shake it up, baby, now shake it up baby 
 leave me here in misery 
 
 we all live in a yellow submarine 
 i our baby, and come on, wanna dance with me 
 if you wanna dance with me 
 if you wanna dance with me 
 if you wanna dance with me 
 if you wanna dance with me 
 if you wanna dance with me 
 if you leave me 
 
 what can i do. 
 can't you get a little child 
 little child, won't you dance with me? 
 i'm the lonely one, as lonely as i can 
 
 but now today 
 i roll a stoney 
 well you can imitate everyone you know 
 yes you can imitate everyone you know 
 yes you can radiate everything
