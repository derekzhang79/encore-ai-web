 
 i got my bag, run to the station 
 railman says you've got the sun 
 you and me chasing paper 
 getting nowhere 
 on our way 
 cos we may free it's getting better all the time 
 
 everybody pulled their day for you, yea 
 
 and now she is mine 
 i think you're fine 
 cos i won't be there with you 
 and all i gotta do 
 is thank you girl, thank you girl 
 
 my independence my mind and tell you 
 maybe someday soon it'll change 
 
 you say you'll be mine, you 
 
 but if you go carrying pictures of chairman mao 
 you ain't going home 
 
 and now you've changed your mind 
 i cry for me 
 
 i'll play the part and i left you 
 
 well, it's good to me, oh yeah 
 
 bright too much a, too much younger than today 
 i tell you but your loving of her 
 she was so hard to reason 
 
 love you now 
 but i've just lost the world i feel a time
