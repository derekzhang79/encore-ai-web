 please stop your lying, you've got me crying, girl 
 why should it be so much to ask of you 
 what you're doing to me? 
 
 i've been waiting here for you 
 wond'ring what you're sweet 
 i'd give you everything i've got 
 for a little peace of mind 
 i love you 
 and that she will cry 
 when the rain comes down 
 i'm glad it's your birthday 
 happy birthday to you 
 
 ah lucille 
 your pepper taught the band to play 
 they've been going in and that the rain, washed away 
 has left a pool of tears, crying for the day 
 but i'm so sad and lonely 
 baby take a chance with me 
 baby take a chance with me 
 baby take a chance with me 
 baby take a chance with me 
 baby take a chance with me 
 baby take a chance with me 
 baby take a chance with me 
 baby take a chance with me 
 baby take a chance with me 
 baby take a chance with me 
 baby take a chance with me
