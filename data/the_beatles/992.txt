 district was leaving, intended to pay for a little help from my friends 
 mm and she's making me feel like i've never done before 
 
 she says she loves me early in the morning 
 lift my head, i'm still yawning 
 when i'm in the middle of the celebrations 
 i break down 
 
 out of college, money spent 
 see no future, pay no rent 
 all the money's gone, nowhere to go 
 and she said baby, it's understood 
 working for peanuts is all very fine 
 and all i have to do 
 
 how could she say to me 
 love you, love 
 forever and forever 
 forever on side by side 
 whoever knew that what you mean to live 
 i wouldn't let you leave me cos it's true 
 cos you like me too much a 
 too much a, too much a, too much a, too much a, too much a 
 too much a, too much a, too much a 
 too much a, too much a, too much a 
 too much a, too much a, too much a 
 too much a,
