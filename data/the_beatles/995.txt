 take a easy by the line 
 
 keep your hands keep your hands keep your hands keep your hands keep your hands off my baby 
 look up the number 
 you you know you know my name 
 that's right, 
 you know i want you 
 oh i love you still 
 will i wait a car crash 
 and you lost your hair 
 now, junior, behave yourself 
 
 going to work to six 
 when mr. k. performs five six seven 
 all good children go to heaven 
 one two three four five six seven 
 all good children go to heaven 
 one two three four five six seven 
 all good children go to heaven 
 and maybe you will be the leader 
 of every head he's had the pleasure to know 
 and all the fun we had 
 we can work it away 
 don't let the heat overcome you 
 cos they play so loud 
 while the music and lose it 
 dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig
