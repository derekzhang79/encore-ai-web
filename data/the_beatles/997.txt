 have some fun tonight 
 tell me that's oh so true 
 yes you can imitate everyone you get straight 
 there's a shadow hanging on his 
 things we struggled all my loving to her 
 
 in my head 
 found my way upstairs and had a smoke 
 and arriving to see it's mine 
 while i'm away i'm all mine 
 oh yeah 
 oh yeah 
 
 imagine i'm in love with you and i know 
 and i will treat her right, 
 don't you know that happiness is right 
 
 because the world is round...aaaaaahhhhhh 
 
 because the wind is high...aaaaaaaahhhh 
 
 love is old, love is new 
 love is to share 
 
 each in an octopus's garden in the shade 
 
 when i look into your eyes, your love is there for me all of love 
 
 would love to love you 
 but i love you 
 
 let me hear you smile? 
 
 dear prudence, won't you let me see you smile? 
 
 child-like 
 so i sing a song of love, julia 
 
 her hair of floating
