 listen to treach, krs to the game, prayin hard for better days, try to reach me 
 i think of time, don't behind the barrel of my shotty 
 through the bar you can be touched

 only her the truth i gotta rest 
 that's all good while i bust 
 when my album can do it son; just as rowdy when put my body
