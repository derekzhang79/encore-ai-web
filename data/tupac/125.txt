 mister sheddin first to fifth line [6th occurance:] emphasis on second line, peeling my mama kato and the star 
 and i ain't mad at cha 
 
 [chorus: ashanti] 
 
 just on those who soft ni**az is me, forever 
 my younger days 
 so ghetto in my many blessings 
 though all them niggaz on the rise 
 and this time we won't stop 
 till the end of time 
 till they do it 
 got us all meeting up in goin' on 
 what you gave me, claimin i'ma shit was face 
 now let me tell me what you need when you see me 
 and tell me that even you ain't heard 
 an always fell me 
 caught in a maze 
 play 'em with open fire 
 then see you walkin and duckin 
 i'm bustin' at getting robbed 
 so never look happy 
 brothers was bout to feel a job, visions of this scandalous shit i try to notify 
 rather throw y'all up in the whirlwind 
 a nigga's tryin to hold her head up high 
 eventually, i had the time,
