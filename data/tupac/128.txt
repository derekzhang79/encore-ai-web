 waitin for the pain that i felt inside 
 best recognize i won't be denied, when we ride 
 
 seen her clutching at pictures 
 and i'll be there in and sucker game 
 and the range stops these niggas from the two of them 
 backstabbin snakes grabbin at my fuckin wealth

 where this is thug in your life 
 so don't let me find like me, that too baby..

 but i remind you cause i wanna be 
 and turns and turns and turns.. haha 
 and turns and turns and turns.. haha

 and gettin stalked by these crooked cops stick
