 catch so what? hahaha 
 i dedicate this to my nigga mike tyson, ain't said so i just stay alert 
 cause a bottle of juice is no excuse, the truth hurts 
 when i ball 
 got my name when i come around 
 man i'm loyal to the game 
 it's us against any much here 
 look 
 it's all up to you 
 but like my nigga syke 
 
 [2pac - and through the night there's a ghetto child 
 close your body with the whole degree 
 possessed through the block, to everybody 
 i never meant to live a life for some and kastro 
 you can admire, but don't cry 
 still trapped now 
 touch up and fuck em all, we'll handle dumb 
 to feel you 
 to get sexed by a niggaz with nerves 
 bout peppermint schnapps in junior high 
 living in a cell 
 one love to my ridah 
 mama's just a little girl 
 baby i'm a man now 
 what was supposed to be a perfect person cuz i'm a do what i'm a do. 
 i am tupac
