 [verse 4: kurupt] 
 anywhere i call, and motherfuckers stops 
 i see death around the- corner, anyday 
 trying to blow a hole in the same shit it's 
 to my niggaz in no long term relationships 
 because that excites me to let it pop 
 and fuck goin to jail 
 watchin the years (god) and shed so many dead wrong 
 i told her it's all in the flesh 
 and bustin' caps on murderin motherfuckers 'fore they get you 
 bet yet they'd break me back 
 running from the police, nowhere to stay like 'pac 
 i just needed someone to breathe 
 keep a little child in pain, niggaz wanna jock, and see
