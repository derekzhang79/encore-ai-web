 
 please let back 
 and i had you mufflin your screams 
 we was throwin' down down 
 my nigga lil' homies 
 fishin for fake niggaz, observe and still i'm hittin fences 
 narc's on a cop, i trying to make it my fault papa didn't know me 
 niggaz is on it's on but 
 wipe your pistols 
 let 'em make you fade yourself 
 my adversaries, cause of my arrest, my life is stressed will lead 
 and die for em 
 lives they could 
 cause my mama told me baby be patient cause you just to understand, i'm crazy so i'm angry 
 i made myself, raised myself 
 watch the ceiling 
 scratch my ak 
 commitin sins we be ready for whatever 
 modu, he's lookin like larry holmes, flabby and he could 
 one to hit my gun 
 dope with no health care 
 we will not fall, 
 these 4-5 with this bullshit 
 trapped in the mornin 
 now he always kickin it 
 
 [chorus: spoken word] 
 who makes 'em 
 i couldn't sleep, that's what tupac never do 
 these ni**az actin up
