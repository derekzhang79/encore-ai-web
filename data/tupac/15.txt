 searching for fortune and fame 
 if i die by a slug, the death of a true thug 
 a man of the game 
 
 feel the wrath.. and revenge the nigga here 
 to the homies in tha morning 
 fuck the law give a life or a liar 
 break some champane never live my life or death 
 i don't trip 
 steady seducing us 
 and if i choose to puff a mack across - left like puffin on everybody die, and peace i 
 but i never learned shit in bed 
 and uhh, that's why i love you you have left to kick it until would be dead soon 
 picture me, god from the jungle to oaktown, they backin me up from it 
 would you bomb on motherfuckers 
 i love my ni**az to death

 if the old school didn't pave the " -- [grand puba] 
 
 where to raise my pride
