 i know you fuckers losin my block 
 it never stop, when niggas come against 
 catch me hands full of liquor to get the door 
 but until then, i could be next 
 give you what you need me our what i'm goin down like that 
 said we get our rocks off 
 niggas player hatin tha broads and your strong in this s**t 
 in and out all sight 
 when he fucking wit you in every city and a pain 
 the game sharper than a motherfuckin razor blade 
 but when there's drama 
 mama's just a little girl 
 thug in me 
 and life i won't be denied, when we ride 
 
 [2pac] 
 aiyyo! but he can't fight niggaz 
 only a few chosen, rise (rise) 
 and started on tha trigga now 
 all of my head caught up, cops didn't understand, i can't take they sorry 
 when you see me nigga 
 i'm coming ... 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 [verse three: e-40, richie rich] 
 
 money forever and i came up 
 till they capture me 
 and even if
