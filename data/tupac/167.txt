 what the fuck is after the respect 
 i won't deny it, i'm a straight ridah / black years 
 more than just romantic feelings 
 turn into his crew when i come around 
 boom boom motherfucker and you can't help but die into a circle beatin jealous it took time to finally even when will i die? 
 it's fate, it seems the arguments are nightly 
 i wanna make you mine
