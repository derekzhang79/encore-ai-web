 thuggin 
 probably in grind mood 
 hustle to the pop song 
 and all the day the screams in the there, 
 forty cals, extended clips, still i don't care 
 money i'm a end up 
 so grab the old song 
 brothers here are bumpin i betta by starin under the carpet 
 we gonna do when you get outta jail? 
 i'm gonna buy me a gun 
 then what's next? 
 food and sex, house parties in the projects cause we goin' all night 
 wishing they'd stop 
 if i'm buck wild ? 
 i don't want you to throw them back 
 time to play my head clear 
 
 [syke] 
 nigga what?, nigga you gotta watch your step! 
 you need to check it 
 
 [chorus: x2] 
 what's goin' on 
 another mother cries 
 what's goin' on 
 but it's hard to rhythm up 
 sure as hollow points shatter, enemies 
 so you bullshittin' bitches ain't changin' me off the bottle i wonder if heaven got the fuckin ring 
 and if the bass line's thick, it's
