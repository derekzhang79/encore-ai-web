 an unexpected birth worst way 
 dre will always continue to grow, 
 as my glock now 
 little man learned so rough to the slots where when i come around the way the played it 
 i'm going through their family 
 i try to get your lobster and crab 
 cause all you mothafuckas 
 that passed too early 
 all the young thugs, the have-nots you know 
 i close around the mutha fuckin' family 
 before i find my soul? 
 from the motherfuckin way you dancin on the floor it was self-defense, he won't even know i gotta get mine 
 it's time to turn the streets to a war zone 
 any me tape, the world could call me 
 even if i hit the hoochies do 
 and there i go, there i come through dumpin insane 
 stop how we fed up 
 until then we takin by gettin the punk ass whipped 
 for a crooked nigga too 
 
 [tupac] 
 i better roll i 
 but i ain't east coast enough to come and heal me once again
