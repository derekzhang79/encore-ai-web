 sneak thinking who don't leave me 
 but you can be touched 
 
 [chorus: jazze pha] 
 you the fast life we'll take the game and i'ma make it about to get a leader to follow 
 i wanna eat you with this motherfuckin slavery 
 i moved out and we don't sell 
 never done stacked man, fuck that shit 
 
 [2pac over chorus] 
 
 [tupac] 
 
 i'm on my side, ooh yeah 
 i dedicate this, to what's bebe's kids 
 put your hands over after fiends 
 i feel lucky, 
 fuckin with the real yo and black i hit the rest 
 i'm feeling stronger than a fuckin till i'm banned 
 it's the same time 
 just no more pain 
 nigga done stick nigga 
 we ain't the witness without the shit 
 getting better 
 keep your mind on your mind 
 niggas put a block, ready to bust 
 it's back to coastin 
 who can i trust in this cold world 
 and my hand's on the prize 
 finger on tha trigga 
 lil' brothers shoulda fucked
