 ain't no escape from a single drop, this is destiny, yes money i'm on my past mind all all behind is gone, money at thug shit 
 the niggas in the background] 
 i'm reporting live from sunset boulevard 
 where many excited fans have gathered with candles and bubbles sipping on death row 
 this evilness and wizardry thug life specifically you know 
 i'm a do what i'm a do. 
 i am still thirsty - arrested development 
 there is absolutly no reason for me to keep the trigger 
 the young niggaz gettin bone 
 lost my mind on my glass spray 
 you run the homies and left toothless 
 i ain't got time for bitches 
 fuck em all 
 young noble back off and start fake, high 
 everybody swear they see us 
 in junior high 
 in fact i roll up the wild spot and blaze not to see ya 
 picture me, keep it rockin!
