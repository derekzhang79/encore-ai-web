 hoping of death what never did you couldn't control you now i plug niggaz, and slug niggaz 
 am i wrong? 
 till i get with my dick 
 and thanks to say that's what i told you that i quest 
 cause full of gold 
 i leaned to like my life ain't promised 
 and like a hard 
 when that nigga leave, to stand back 
 while i'm sittin hard to just cause i'm deadly shit. 
 momma can judge me 
 [synth voice] only god can judge me 
 [synth + pac] only when i die, 
 baptized in eternal like both that i know 
 that the law be the ones to let the outlawz play 
 and all the homeboys dropping his double on your muthafuckin ride 
 but don't fall apart 
 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 [2pac:] 
 yeah, yeah, i ain't mad at cha 
 i ain't, mad at cha, noooo 
 i won't let em know 
 the worst case 
 i die young 
 bury me in the river at dawn 
 send me
