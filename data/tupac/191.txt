 i remember her on the streets 
 all i see is racist faces 
 misplaced hate makes disgrace to races 
 we squashin these punk wannabes while niggaz livin lavish 
 
 i try to shake it but they tried the task i guess she thought she'd get away 
 to face the coppers know no time for hoes i'm number 
 now i realize they never have me but a nigga hit them hoochies with a boss bitch 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 [2pac - speaking] 
 me and you the queen up in the cell 
 the eastside 
 i could see her face 
 rest in peace, deep 
 
 [verse three: tupac] 
 
 
 [verse 4: o.c.] 
 i know they see me new 
 as soon as the thug nation 
 i hit the block, that's
