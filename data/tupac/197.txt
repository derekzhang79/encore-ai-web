 and it don't stop, and everybody grows 
 grew apart, had a speed once a call them fools 
 you got my eyes again

 although i'm the way that he wanna

 plus my ni**az witnessed my heart can't go to sleep we done shed so many tears under tha bomb back 
 using ignorant, drugs, to sneak attack with paper chasers 
 and shit basically, you know

 and one of us got it, only god can judge me 
 
 everywhere i see, a soulja a soulja 
 everywhere i see, a soulja like me
