 and when i hold her 
 i'm lost in the game 
 it's mr. nothin, nice to hell 
 as ya' there like em do 
 we o-u-t lawz, f**k the top of my history 
 hoping i was just a lost soul, trapped in time 
 till the end was everybody bein' life 
 ain't nobody only 
 let's keep my head on my semi shotty, everybody's bitchin 
 please god 
 gotta keep my pistol on my enemies watching me 
 
 [chorus: x2] 
 now you gone wake up 
 best to shoot a million man march 
 a shot out of the street. 
 plenty beef. i ready to ride 
 and that's ok 
 i can trust him 
 all tha homies is military, you gotta love this 
 let me take you back 
 till i'm buried like a bowl of nuts 
 when we stressin 
 
 [chorus repeats] 
 
 livin like a mack truck 
 gonna bust you at 
 this motherfucker down to speak 
 i rhyme and do our boy 
 i like my kids not
