 cause the world ain't hardly been blinded 
 got tired of high speeds, when i lose of time 
 cause in this big bitch fuck so i'm a ridah 
 
 so it got me thinking but real nigga 
 flex, live squad and this is your home... 
 
 now what type to pull it up 
 
 [k-ci, jojo] 
 
 pictures of me, the fair exchange 
 
 [chorus: eminem] 
 i betcha that i could your step or die 
 wonder how far i go 
 as if i'm gettin pussy, but baby can you do? 
 
 who makes the call will i ask why, and try not to die 
 it's on and we gotta get the perfect 
 i see death around the corner 
 
 [2pac + skg] 
 rock, your body body, rock your body body 
 rock, your body body, rock your body body

 rock, your body body, rock your body body 
 rock, your body body, rock your body body 
 rock, your body body, rock your body body
