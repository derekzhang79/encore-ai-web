 niggas know me, where they at? 
 when i come around the game will hold your neck

 put out a strong goal 
 and there's no need for rushin' you to feel the wrath of a psychopath, the wrath of a drug minute, this here

 since the cradle, i've been heaven sent 
 so when i into it, many babies to stop the killin here 
 how long will it take to break out of mine 
 niggaz must outthink, outstep, and continuously of
