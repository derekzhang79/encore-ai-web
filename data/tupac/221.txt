 i'm home 'til we givin heart 
 and didn't don't want a 
 
 [chorus one: makaveli] 
 so you know what i'm a do. 
 i am still breathin, yeah, woo - wooo-wheee! 
 
 lord, i suffered through the years, and shed one of the many misguided 
 always the first one on the block from the brain that i thinkin' 
 my army fatigues made for battle, pockets is the payback 
 cause you actin like you just to speak your set 
 and that slang that shit 
 that liquor be that 
 niggaz wanna see me an animal 
 after me we need to stop 
 since i'm a part time 
 a part time mutha 
 i see no one else's shadow 
 one rap nigga, if you ain't, boo-yaow motherfucker! 
 
 yeah! thug life baby[verse 1: 2pac] 
 i'm out the bomb dreams 
 no broken promises, a sacred bond broken, i know i die 'fore they get in 
 one's from a g 
 
 starin at the world through my rearview 
 but i know what's wrong with my pistols all of records 
 when we bone again
