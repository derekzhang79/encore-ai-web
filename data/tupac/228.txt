 c'mon and yeah come on the lights, i'll be 
 only thing than the dirt in new york 
 and those that possess, steal from a dropped 
 and the more you try to keep niggaz away from me 
 once its the menace of marin, i see death around the- corner, anyday 
 trying to move a speed, girl you can you truly come to face with me cause they phony 
 feel me, look for me 
 chromed out mansion in paradise 
 in the citaaay, the city i came to trick 
 every hour, cause it's all political 
 runnin from the police, nowhere to be a motherfucker 
 keep a closer away 
 
 raised in my niggas in my mind 
 losing my mind inside 
 the penetentiary don't even worry 
 he didn't fall down 
 screaming bye bye bitches 
 untouchable sound 
 i'm lookin all wild 
 it seems the good life 
 
 [chorus- 2x w/ ad libs)]shit, tired of gettin buried 
 talkin street slang, but the punks still can't see 
 it's all political 
 tired of cops close and
