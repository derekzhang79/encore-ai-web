 fake-ass bitches, male and female 
 just if my homies call you bitch again 
 that ain't cool 
 when the day i rip 
 i see some baldin-ass niggaz for us 
 it's death row, hear any pictures to me yet 
 i load my nine and they count down to midnight 
 now my plan for a wife, my dead homeboys 
 outlaw my fate 
 go on my throat 
 
 [chorus repeats] 
 if you really want it 
 if, you really want it, five by the floor 
 and only time we left them as hell to all the criminal first block 
 i was rich i had clout, now a nigga 35 
 gettin ghost on the five-oh, fuck friends 
 fuck life 
 stuck in tha house 
 god promised, she's so scandalous 
 she's so scandalous.. she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous.. she's so scandalous, she's so we made it 
 if we could 
 i'm runnin' from paris homie pick me up im at the dress 
 straight 
 to throw it all away 
 what's goin' on 
 another siren
