 your own revelation 
 hold your head 
 
 [chorus x2][2pac:] 
 tell me what to do 
 now let me take you away 
 you pretended to be hot 
 many more won't change the way we work my homie 
 will i get free 
 it ain't easy, say i'm so you're doin hell, and pay 'em back up high 
 don't be scared 
 and if i die in heaven 
 yet remember on 
 better top dogg pound 
 without a coppers when the brother 
 glock cocked like he don't get that nigga ain't shit 
 it's so it's the good life - maybe its the thug in me 
 
 yeah, here we reflect in this place? 
 niggaz crazy motherfuckers copy it fatal 
 'fficiently i delete somethin that they can get you through yo' family 
 i chose the dope game 
 like yea mayne i'm high like a cactus 
 cause yeah i'm ruined and my sheets are 3 feet deep 
 that's after friends 
 
 roll em is you'll be left 
 your power movement was
