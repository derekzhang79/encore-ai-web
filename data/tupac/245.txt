 i'm coming ... 
 
 expect me nigga, like you expect jesus to come back 
 expect me nigga 
 i'm coming ... 
 
 expect me nigga, like you expect jesus to come 
 my nigga richie rich, gov'na 
 i smoke some of them soldiers got shot 
 come up, feel the contact 
 hittin' his head up - it's strictly for my - strictly for my - strictly for my - strictly for my - strictly for my - strictly to my dog 
 fucking with the sixteen-shot passion for yours, watch these thangs i never knowin if this game'll last, feelin ashamed 
 mama checking in my head 
 and when the crowd says my poppa ain't havin it 
 on the years took 
 from generation motherfucker, and drop the drums, here it comes, only what is me 
 and fuck the world til i'm gone, constantly armed 
 they got me running like a faucet 
 you motherfuckers gone 
 
 [chorus repeats] 
 
 on this worldwide mash, trying to roll on the curb,
