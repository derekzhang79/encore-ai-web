 the struggle better in whispered tones 
 ni**az is stealing my s**t 
 and though we learn to pray, keep every faith in these rap days 
 so don't sleep when my jeep creep up, how we hit the homies 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 from the cradle to the lights, of the ghetto for years 
 when i never end, i don't get their ass 
 how can you hang? 
 cause when it's on it's on but 
 ya know what i'm saying. i thugged out. now i'ma two homies 
 fuck bein' tame, set a flame, tryin' to straight coastin' 
 these sorry letters 
 soon as the sky get bright, it's just another borin' monday 
 an' there's nothin' else to play with me and now who you breathe 
 they got me trapped in this s**t 
 my heart is sayin big enough to stab me 
 rip hoes up 
 the iller-fied pimping-ass gang to gave these scandalous strung past guns and let the lord word to the bother 
 we better not find where you stay 
 
 it's the name game same kids 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 [tupac] 
 fuck
