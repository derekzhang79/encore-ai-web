 feel me! makaveli the don up 
 i'm in a escapade 
 but could reply when my niggas we all die 
 in my back, so every time i hear ya! 
 [repeat 2x] 
 i used to these hard to be optimistic 
 when i'm gone, still i ain't scared, 
 here i’m bussin’ off the hennessey 
 it smell like skunk, skunk smell like that bitch, and we clown, when i flow, i can remember scrapin back to 
 live my life as an white side 
 see me in physical form, my niggaz on the back i gotta be 
 and i can't be down with no clause for all this time 
 
 the good die 
 they our seeds and when ya see me 
 i don't drink st. ides fuck that! 
 genuine draft ganja ganja and my enemies dead n buried, now they all in the hood game 
 
 ooh, i shed a tear, i gotta never visualize you can fuck with me bet i listen 
 ain't no escape from these hard times in the dark with less spark.
