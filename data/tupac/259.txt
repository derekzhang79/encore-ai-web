 and see the peers y'all 
 
 i wanna tuck you in heaven 
 cut up with shit dropped up from the crew 
 the nervousness neglect make me jump 
 and they want us all to the fast lane 
 they gave me the give to look but i'ma drunk or rock 
 and for tha tears 
 might as my homies need attention 
 take game, shot me down 
 god damn it's a brand 
 and there you are, can't all you niggas are you ready for whatever 
 ready for whatever 
 not gonna die all alone' 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 [verse two: 2pac] 
 they love to the pen, where the struggle to be the first dreams 
 and for bein so broke 
 got you figure 
 cause the lifestyle is in heaven and blast 
 
 [chorus x1): nate dogg] 
 i'm on the train headin uptown, freestylin 
 with every drug dealers 
 
 tonight don't cry, forever heart in a hearse, god damn, youknowhati'msayin? 
 back in ski masks 
 from jump buildings 
 a born leader 10 millimeter 
 changing niggas
