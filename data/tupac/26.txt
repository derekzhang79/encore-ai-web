 and the rich is looking dim 
 i'm trying to end up at the slightest stop 
 bitches and mash 
 and if i die 
 how many pistols in the old days 
 motherfuckers we are unstoppable 
 and uhh, i'm not goin alive! when i could be the victim of them bastards 
 living life dog

 yeah right, little times on some dirty words 
 young noble come out, wanna die

 just stay smart 
 now we out for power, you punk police gone 
 i could remember being whupped in class 
 and even thou it was her 
 not hard to carry on when no one loves 
 they need him at the fuckin hell nigga

 from here to hide 
 look to his own responsibilities
