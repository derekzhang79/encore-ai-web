 still can't help but now.. i don't do nobody 
 but like a pops can't stop me 
 only god can judge me 
 [synth voice] only god can call me my nigga, what i love ya 
 can't bust bullets to tha life i live was as my posse 
 
 some say the government will watch me 
 you could walk a mile in my shoes 
 
 [chorus] 
 panther power 
 
 [verse 5: kadafi] 
 come feel the wrath of a psychopath, the wrath of you 
 lo and behold you had to you do what i feel, reflect my set 
 back in the street still made it 
 got me tryin to creep. 
 no feedback is what he uttered, before he givin but it was fast enough, yep 
 i got my mama stressin and they say 
 what to give you up to right back 
 never visioned me and they needin 
 and i'm bustin at tha ruffest dollar 
 listen before i wake 
 don't pull the price to be played 
 so the choice is my soul 
 mama never missin - who
