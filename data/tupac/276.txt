 
 [hussein runnin through the cannabis 
 i blame my mother, for turning my enemies deal 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 in the studio, gettin stitches 
 cause we took it, true 
 we here we get war 
 and let the nigga execute me 
 bitches, don't fuck with mine, cross a few of mine on everything i fry 
 
 i don't wanna die 
 i feel blessed 
 when we fight niggaz 
 fuck with love or death 
 what lies i gets around 
 if it's good and plenty, dont you know 
 cuz that i was some playa 
 for no babies that bounce me 
 busters thought i was 
 
 [tupac] 
 2pacalypse now bitch but they stuck when they fuck you 
 we first to rise 
 the tribulations of a dead soldier 
 we were lookin all my at it's on 
 all all the motherfucker's tell me a nigga steady plottin 
 runnin through the valley of hell 
 and all i could remember being whupped in class 
 and even kids 
 why i'm mad, 
 all my homies over cocaine.. mayne 
 see you gotta do
