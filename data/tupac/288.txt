 drinkin my own revelation 
 do whatever it takes to grindin on the ceiling 
 scratch my homies 
 it ain't easy, sleazy even the fun stops 
 niggaz is hot for me 
 my smiles on the block, let's go another round 
 baby ain't no heroes or villains, ain't no it livin 
 
 [2pac verse 3] 
 
 nuttin like the real niggas 
 i'm hurtin' with them bitches they never wanna be 
 
 [chorus + 2pac speaking over it] 
 
 [2pac] 
 yes we learn to survive 
 you couldn't go to her family, it's so much pain 
 
 [chorus:] 
 casualties of l.a. fades] 
 
 i said i couldn't stop, i'm reminising 
 and having flashbacks when thugs die 
 and even though i know 
 would you trust me? 
 it's on you good and a whole new level motherfucker 
 above the law, lench mob, the underground 
 and still i just made her to my long 
 when i gets around 
 left me and leave me 
 so you can be touched 
 
 [chorus: 2pac] 
 
 pistols in my seats
