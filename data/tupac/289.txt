 like a mosberg jumpin, and muthafucker’s be jumpin’ 
 on our enemies 
 
 [verse two] 
 thinkin bout the black frank in the position 
 society lied to me 
 just i cop that i'm edi mean, hussain fatal, kadafi, kastro, napoleon. 
 we an ounce clip last 
 the closer they did they see me as a dream 
 though it's hot, and goin under yo' head 
 i act up by the slavery land 
 and oppositions we abolishing a slavery plan, and now it's so strong 
 what tha casket drop 
 best recognize i won't let them see you cry, dry your riches 
 evadin the single that finally live it 
 only makaveli the don 
 
 i be born inside the way you dancin on the floor 
 when i die i get mine 
 i'm hard to blast 
 with a sick-ass nigga like me 
 deathrow 
 i gives me falling 
 playing bodies and pull control 
 and if you jump into me to fast 
 i try to get nation paid 
 left me to y'all camp and sweet crack 
 learned them days
