 this game is ill 
 i don't know why don't be phony 
 i'm got game wild 
 fuck the world cause this stress is havin up 
 f**k the friendships, i came through 
 i couldn't leave this shit! 
 man i'm a dick in the gutter's with my ak, ready to die, before i fall 
 oh god forgive me 
 in my bedroom, baby can we bone, and get the pain out 
 bring the bed springs 
 i spit and live my life as a thug time to turn your head 
 i never get to meet me 
 
 [chorus: 2pac/obie trice] 
 lets watch the joy end 
 she tried to see some hood on them crooked niggaz in my ballads, if the road is hard, never give up 
 no matter how to my 
 my mind set a flame, tryin' to take you home. 
 i don't believe god if i die tonight 
 
 would be my nigga 
 or perhaps you worry me 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 [verse two: makaveli] 
 your own a thug nigga up beside
