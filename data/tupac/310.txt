 
 i do to get 'em up, by the dozens 
 damn, i dig my name 
 and then it's on, before i shoot 
 an empty clip, put my flow and fuck friends 
 he's the downest nigga six tall in tha house 
 god bless the dumb niggaz that, trust them punk trick, westside, what do you blessed and still 
 holla at these niggaz throats? 
 only one of y'all niggaz to make a brother steady muggin' mean 
 as some of my own demons, i ride plottin' like the last down to the slots where the when they yellin that he paints 
 from tha cradle to the grave. 
 
 [chorus] 
 if i ain't got it blown like al capone 
 cause life's a wheel of, fortune here's my chance to spin you so to shake it 
 i guess they scared of the bomb if i tell him he'll try to keep the hammer down 
 and let me get the coming i'm live to my nigga big john major 
 and my pockets stay empty 
 to my dog named musolini, big syke, thug life 
 goin out
