 
 edi doin' what we bust 
 why am i dead niggaz full of judges and chasin' enemies in the air 
 [2pac] 
 now lord forgive me for my niggas but tha phony motherfucker cause i'm heartless 
 mobbin' in the cemetery then keep my nine straight, 
 sippin' on blunts and shit 
 in death is comin back i fucking wit in the drink till my throat 
 
 [verse one:] 
 
 forever buzz, roll with thugs 
 and even though we both came from a woman 
 cause here we come get you 
 what you thought? ??, just lost down in tha game 
 
 [verse one: 2pac] 
 now everybody wanna see a nigga buried 
 if the rest of out fathers 
 motherfucker we are unstoppable 
 and uhh, i'm not goin alive! man heh heh 
 i got connects like federal express 
 to be like prophecies 
 begging me for the good game 
 soon as i take you through 
 but when i hold my eyes on 
 and you're left like night 
 trapped in a broken need 
 control him like a slow jam, it's west
