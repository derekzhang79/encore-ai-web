 
 while you proceed with ni**az when i meet her i'ma offer her a crooked nigga too 
 
 [2pac + e.d.i amin] 
 you know? 
 i live my life as a thug nigga, until the day i die 
 live tha life of a ghetto nigga's lullabye 
 don't cry, at the wrong place at the west coast baabbby 
 all tupac 
 pack a projects, finally rise 
 i'm hurtin' but call the cops in this motherfucker 
 trust bein in his place 
 and even though the precious was slow down 
 
 when i'm just a fantasy 
 a way to have a black need to see 
 y'all niggas ain't aimin' back my way 
 i'm stacked rules from all my kids break, 
 want em with this ol' fools 
 in the coldest nights out, say wild coming up 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 now, rock-a-bye baby, i'm thugged out. well 
 how much to be your turn... word 
 
 dear momma eh, how do i plead? 
 yes sir, how do we ask you? 
 [girl] 
 so many killings 
 it's a try to put me in the west
