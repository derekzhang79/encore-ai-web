 when i'm goin to jail 
 nowhere to live a little nigga 
 but like i'm into sexy capers 
 check the blunt and my sheets 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 [verse three: 2pac] 
 dear momma don't know what i know about you 
 hell nah nah, nigga pay 
 with a sick-ass nigga 
 cause i love her, but it hurts to hear her calling 
 brenda wants to hurt to prison, that gangbangin 
 bustin my pay 
 stop back to tha bay 
 your babies ass 
 and no cause, 
 what should it bother me? 
 but i ain't forgot home one like you supllied jenny craig to help the fuck i lost 
 street fame 
 to this click i'm dedicated, criminal orientated 
 my phony homey go to see 
 i just ain't no livin forever but we use the same partner 
 
 [nate] 
 you know which day i'm about to sleep 
 i know it lasts longer, gets my real nigga in his feet, quick 
 pass the tears nigga 
 
 my eyes blurred 'fore i get to poppin i hit rock bottom,
