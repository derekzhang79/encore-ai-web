 why explain the game? 
 riding off up in tha driveway 
 i shot my block 
 where 'em tell me not to live the good 
 a bottle of juice is no excuse, the truth hurts 
 and you was heartless on your enemies, and feel a boss bitch 
 and i gotta do what i bust, so thats our motherfucking motto nigga?

 ooooh, lady watchin lady watchin as i'm glidin by glidin by 
 with player haters 
 a all " 
 but they feel wild 
 i didn't believe you for you 
 but until then i gotta be down here in a house you a need to be 
 lookin down my pocket or women 
 and pay 'em back mother 'cause they in old positions 
 now where all i see is all those motha fuckin 
 and those who wish to die 
 we're gon' grow 
 and watch 'em all scatter 
 explode on they beefs for weeks 
 
 a shot of leaving hell 
 as i take the game from a young g. 
 i'm st8 ballin'!
