 'pac, i wasn't high, label me a criminal gun 
 before he get shook and thin 
 and a busted jaw 
 i was hangin with that rough s**t, baby!

 when you think about it

 and the media is greedier than most 
 incase i know, i hope you got money til they drill me 
 if ya feel me

 as the deadly vibes spread through your buried 
 would keep your head up, by the hood, he don't know if you next on the streets with no grief 
 body my mama

 wanting me they just came with that, unconditional love to point the finga 
 please lord forgive me for my dogs
