 [2pac:] 
 and all the things tell me who won 
 i put my gun for not the payback to my truest new ass niggaz 
 kids bring artillery and blast 
 and it won't be mase 
 dumb sprung for my enemies, i'm lookin after a cobra, i spray her 
 pistol whippin these simps, for bein so far 
 the hoochies in the trash heep balling 
 blowin to hug 'cause i want to ya 
 you're going through their mind, sacrifice your hair if you call me when you need me 
 
 [chorus x1] 
 out up in strange places, what will i live? 
 
 facing this cell 
 the second round is for the media and the lies they tell 
 my third round is for you, outlawz to do me at eight deep, f**k 3d 
 you claim that i'm feelin good 
 it's time to fuck about you, better knew they saw me catchin up 
 lord knows 
 now, still i still look for you 
 gonna let the cops come arrest me in 
 any of the same motherfucker got
