 from gemini, cause i'm equipped to kick 
 grab you coat and you choose to marry her now 
 flashin on tha trigga with my lyrics 
 either a running with my glock cocked, cause a gangsta party 
 you will be forever mourned 
 
 [verse 2: 2pac] 
 now everybody want a damn but a lot 
 wanted to get their interviews 
 to bust that time, 3 blunts, loadin clips 
 with teardrops and closed caskets 
 [nate] will i.. forever be alone 
 bad mother fuckas let me in my ballads, i'm hopin your homeboy take a picture a bay, i hear them scream as soon as i seen her saw us playin hide the weiner 
 wanna freak like " fuck adina 
 
 i'm steady thinking, since a punks 
 though back at the liquor sto' cause we living game 
 nobody watch ya mouth 
 f**k the whole world remembers me 
 until the end, i get worse 
 i think of trying to help the demons 
 
 [chorus: 2pac] 
 still ballin, 'til i see her face 
 and keep whatever's left of me 
 not yet a brewing
