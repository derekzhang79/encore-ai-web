 my first round is for the lord, what the fuck is that? 
 fake ass ghetto they try to slow down 
 cause you can loose it in the gutter nigga 
 that same lady can you hear me speak! 
 to pay the price of the homies 
 roll with a posse 
 for ya take a trip in this motherfucker 
 you showed me the definition of balling 
 i'm convinced self-defense is by the hands of another guy 
 now you fuckin with a ball 
 i was feeling like hell 
 how long will they mourn me 
 what the casket what a g tonight 
 damn near the cause 
 they say don't wanna get to holla 
 it's not to see a being trap me 
 a crack and a brother hit you, left me 
 pull drama 
 listen to treach, krs to get me feelin' guilty 
 cause girl don't love you, like you expect jesus to come back 
 expect me nigga 
 i'm coming ... 
 
 expect me nigga, like you expect jesus to come back 
 expect me nigga 
 i'm coming ...
