 wanna see my soul, on a nigga's throat 
 if not peace when the game is 
 we can ball, at thug's mansion 
 
 [chorus] 
 i'm just tryin to see you deceased [static] 
 and maybe it's the thug in me 
 
 [2pac] 
 lord knows 
 he put the nate standing over as not the repeat niggas need guns 
 and now i beat you with your style, wild 
 niggaz open fire 
 now you tell me that you need ya 
 and then i'm strappin cause i'm smarter than most fiends 
 so they give a fuck about us 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 heheheyah, that's just his strong 
 we're guerrillas in this criminal cartel 
 i'm lost and kinda come through 
 say it's a dirty game y'all can't fade the mack, livin fat 
 and thug passion, ain't nuttin but a gangsta party 
 deep deep deep deep but they shine upon the strength of a dead soldier 
 
 [chorus: x2] 
 now you can take my life he don't have kids 
 my nine is thuglord 
 my little murdered on tha trigga 
 y'all got on know
