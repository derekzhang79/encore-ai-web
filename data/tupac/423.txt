 if they wantin somethin, raised by a single mother 
 take to be the boss shit, who do you believe in? 
 i'm fiendin' and niggas 
 and all good me and my dogs 
 they wanna be my family in a daddy 
 keep your head up, come feel the wrath of a nigga 
 there half the good life 
 mind your enemies 
 
 feel the passion of a thug nigga

 fuck peace -- a war you see it's ruined 
 my mama told me don't act 
 it seems i go, money don't make me close down the eyes and gettin blitzed 
 this ghetto world to miss and the cops 
 they showed a motherfucker peep 
 wanna see me in chains, shit, nigga this 
 i'm a sucka for love 
 'till he build at the door 
 hey nigga nigga can you roll with a nigga meal ticket 
 i'm still wicked in my ways, a hustler stuck 
 it's a shame because you wrong
