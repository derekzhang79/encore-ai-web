 now introducin young black male 
 i spend most brothers still look good 
 another suicidal by the peer 
 you're not alone 
 had to kill me to roll, commit to violence 
 wessyde mother fuckers 
 'till we die 
 are thugs yet another post-humorous release by tupac 
 which, raises the question 
 picture me rollin to life for y'all 
 yeah i can't trust i don't hear my pride pick a playa 
 with no night in the county jail 
 uptown out the bottle lit the you on the phone 
 ain't a cop that can stop the hit 
 predicted the shit, i'm the last one standin the gun 
 my pistol close in hand 
 learned my mathematics skills from the degree 
 outlawz on a late night! 
 last " 
 i got ya wife on a maze 
 got my, hands on my semi- 
 some say i'm dead around 
 i'm telling ya to listen 
 i'm seein' death around the corner 
 
 [chorus: singers + 2pac] 
 call the evil 
 and oppositions we abolishing a slavery plan, and get over and blazed that shit
