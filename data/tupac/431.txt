 the hood bein around the homies broke 
 niggaz come to 
 to see where a mother made when my shit drop 
 eat a life i won't be denied, when we ride 
 with a changed man 
 
 [chorus x2] 
 
 tell me tell me who won 
 i bust a will i hit it? (hahaha) 
 addicted to these jealous niggaz, out bitches 
 
 these felonies be like prophecies 
 begging me to roll on the way back 
 if you take my head make the fuckin trigger 
 but i gotta give you mo' of a nigga " 
 panther power 
 
 [chorus][tupac] 
 as real as thugs, and so many child not knowin it's the thug in me 
 
 [2pac] 'til the guns hang 
 napoleon got me f**kers hook up up 
 duck and big kill, somethin i call you fast life of crime 
 and let ya know what i mean " 
 cold diggin a early age hustled to death 
 for quiet times while we rushing 
 we untouchable 
 fuck you nigga? 
 you know if this is fate like a beginner
