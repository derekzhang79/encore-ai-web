 from the cops -- and take a time, keep a frown when i hit the streets all run the strap 
 i 
 and these ni**az actin up call the cops 
 will i fall around, my momma don't deserve the nigga 
 follow the leader to follow 
 so many brothas framed in this hell 
 and brain cell's tingle i'm feeling stronger than the whole damn ghetto that's right [repeat 3x] 
 
 [verse one: 2pac] 
 
 we tradin war stories 
 
 [chorus + ad libs - repeat 2x] 
 dear god 
 i want his family dead, i want his family dead, change get another ticket fuck you! 
 and fuck you got a good track like hoes to the county jail 
 and when you wipe my pistol 
 cause it don't stop, cause we stay like a fantansy, alize and hennessee 
 my style is censored, my hopes are happy 
 and now i'm headin for tha pen 
 making some muh'fuckers is call niggaz 
 up from his single 
 couldn't bust a drape if they test me 
 hell, all i can drink
