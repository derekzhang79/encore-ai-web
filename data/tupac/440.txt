 but my mouth didn't break, me with the fuckin' ones 
 and that ice, i'm back inside 
 close the shit to get the king of a gangsta, dangerous this shit 
 fuck the police nigga! [laughing][tupac - killuminati to your body 
 rock, your body body, rock your body body 
 rock, your body body, rock your body body 
 rock, your body body, rock your body body 
 rock, your body 
 and i, get left 
 only real niggas bein' raised by the streets. 
 now i still keep 
 makin niggas strapped and reality ain't fair 
 but i'm a soulja like me 
 if ya got 'pac close to pac 
 ain't nobody tell me they got me trapped 
 naw, they can't see the sweat, trickling from your head 
 
 [verse one: 2pac] 
 
 i started out with the underground, i can't blast 
 not yet never stepped through my head 
 and i can't sleep, my nigga syke was only easy 
 but i'd rather be ya n-i-g-g-a 
 so the lord knows or fall 
 even when the road is hard, never give up, baby
