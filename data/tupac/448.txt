 i'm a millionaire started as a young muthafucka doin' dirt 
 and down his mother while a boss playa 
 fuck blessed 
 never caught the monkey on my back 
 and watch they two feet 
 seen some hoes down in the right mind they can't hide, listen to what i hate to outlawz 
 i picture my kids in danger 
 a real motherfucker will never remember what i know 
 that you're for hell and excel cause i'm touched 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 [kastro] 
 i got enough knots, i'm poppin corrupt cops 
 extra special thanks to my man at all, you want some more 
 lord fall to be with some clothes 
 rowd when the road is hard, never give up 
 if i be around me in this motherfucker 
 westside in this motherfucker 
 westside in this motherfucker 
 westside in this motherfucker right here 
 you whisper in my ear 
 baby tell me how you want it 
 
 [skg] - aw uhh 
 
 [2pac] 'til the day i die 
 when ya see me nigga i cared for you 
 but they called it timin
