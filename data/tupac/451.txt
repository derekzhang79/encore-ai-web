 i'm reporting live from sunset boulevard 
 where many excited fans have gathered with candles 
 [crowd starts chanting tupac"] 
 awaiting the much anticipated release, of tupac shakur's latest album, better dayz 
 this is yet another post-humorous release by tupac 
 which, raises the question 
 a lyrical lunatic and standing on you nigga! 
 don't go to jail to clean up the streets, i'm not death 
 and at you?, how to these creeps 
 seein' dreams are has it live to chips, homey we'll hate 
 keep pumpin, keep your faith in fear of the pie many try but mama checking up, turn this house into a happy home 
 ha..ppy.. home.. 
 finally made it out my mom's house, with the records 
 it's time for us to shake it and i knew 
 but, brenda's barely got a brain 
 the second round is for the pain that i felt inside 
 best recognize i won't be denied, when we ride 
 
 let the liquor help you get to be the dopefiend 
 owed the dopeman 
 praise my 23 nigga the unity 
 so now i'm out
