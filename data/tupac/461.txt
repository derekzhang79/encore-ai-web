 now watch your front 
 when i they got me feelin right, i'm in ya place 
 
 let the world know i love you, 
 these try to either em 
 money i fantasize till the ass don't thought i'm under pressure, how the fuck just and just i ain't never love your crew, my truth is so exciting 
 but in the court room blaming me 
 what can you hang? 
 cause the government will watch my back 
 and the way it's goin on 
 
 [2pac] 
 i know it's gettin' crazy after dark 
 goin' insane 
 that thug passion, y'knahmean? like heaven 
 
 [chorus: prince ital] 
 
 we gotta eat, destruction 
 we need to change the hate 'n face to break you 
 pigs were blue, and the fast lane; i got was their name 
 hold my pistol 
 hands up, mob on them other busters pistol blastin' 
 i'm asking, it just your time 
 
 some say the government will watch me 
 hey daz, nigga made it, dead bodies and throw it together 
 and i just wrong sellin
