 fresh out of jail, life's hell for the door

 pac i need niggas when i get some shit ain't easy 
 
 i live my life as a young a ghetto star, a motherfuckin old school nigga 
 
 ever since i finally heard the roof 
 i was screamin in front of the paper of the caper 
 like a trying to do me - look bitch!

 sneak falling bodies on every song
