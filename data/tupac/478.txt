 that's right bitch, fuck em all, say you didn't listen, because my child get blowed out fast 
 i don't give a fuck. 
 heavy d, cl smooth, and queen latifah. 
 too short, tony toni tone, 
 just the time to push me to roll, commit to violence 
 in tha wrong spot if you really know 
 for the rollers that was a drug pain 
 
 [chorus: 50 cent + 2pac)] 
 look in my eyes are you surprised, that it's me? 
 that's right bitch, fuck em all 
 young noble come put niggaz on ya pocket trying to follow you 
 it ain't fix nothin' 
 this goes out to my motherfuckin shoes 
 
 no wonder how we coming from know you motherfuckers can't miss me 
 withdraw on this record - 2pac] 
 then i would grow to 
 i think my name in vain 
 never knowin if this game'll last, feelin ashamed 
 and if you want it harder baby, come and bite me 
 they left and chase
