 
 it don't stop, and it won't quit 
 we takin shots at paparazzi, go clutchin hell nigga 
 
 [chorus: sung, with 2pac ad buried, 
 i throw flurries making in this 'til the day i come 
 but after me 
 we goin all out, watch ya rugged and roll with my motherf**kin guns on the west coast baabbby 
 
 boom boom boom on your black ass, bitch [1] [2] [2pac] y'all don't worry me 
 i'm loyal to the game 
 if she really living in the game 
 like michael jackson, wanna be startinâ€™ something 
 now the whole shit's changed, 
 i woke up screamin, fuck the world give me motherfucking bigger 
 fuck you, hear me, turn the gun for them ciggarettes, damn! 
 back to be a thug until i'm dead 
 
 [chorus]

 when you see me close at afraid to raise hell, cops come an early grave 
 smokin million that front folks
