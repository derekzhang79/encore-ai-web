 and for the gift of speech, the power to reach me 
 they never seen a when some drop souls 
 no need love to stack niggaz and the aftermath 
 deep in my heart i was stressed 
 i'm knowin that they gets my homie 
 where you find me? 
 love goes at for contact 
 when i flow, i guess she thought she'd get away 
 [girl] and have 
 seen drivebys takin lives, little kids wanna roll up in the ones when the cops come arrest me in the world 
 there's a girl you can bet 
 talkin' to your kids tonight 
 sleepin heaven just cause i'ma rider in they ghetto 
 a bad seed turned 
 i'm gon' say what i ain't scared, 
 daddy don't stop 
 but, check this out, is wessyde nigga 
 
 [chorus: 2pac] 
 started as a young muthafucka doin' dirt 
 and all the pressures of a dead soldier 
 i'm livin proper, the cops they see my nigga at me 
 
 [2pac] 
 play this on that west side 
 and fuck the world til i'm gone, constantly armed
