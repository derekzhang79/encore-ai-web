 cause she tried to sell crack, but be slow with this game 'til the draw that's who we came

 servin suckers i think i get my enemies dead n buried, now the beat gettin trapped and thats, real 
 
 but what the fuck done made her mouth - in case my 1 screaming and now mine

 hey yeah, sportin jewels on an early grave 
 after sign
