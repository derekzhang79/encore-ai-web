 to be one of the many misguided 
 always the first is my nigga too 
 
 [chorus: x2] 
 if you trust me 
 hahaha you gotta handle me? 
 my 9 goes pop 
 make dreams room in silence 
 lost ghetto days 
 the one of them bastards 
 he's grateful for cabbage 
 they say they see they see me 
 while your gun in hand 
 can't close you through a brother 
 we was down with niggaz breakin niggaz 
 i'm a hustler hope it get me respect 
 i cut em they cap backwards 
 your nigga, and we ain't hard to find 
 a way and nigga 
 give em the thang to be? 
 and your home 
 pac give less than a fuck 
 don't you trust me? 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 oh you a muslim now, no doubt, aquariuses, libras, i said here 
 if this shit don't freeze shit 
 keep your mind on your black ass, and don't fight with a nigga, and when jail 
 remember me i'm a dead soldier 
 it's just me against the world 
 [2pac:]
