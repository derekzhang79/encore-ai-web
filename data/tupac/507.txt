 take a sip and see who am i went to dark, smokin newports, gamin marks 
 got my eyes open bodies and still terrified, i'll see 
 but from tha day i bring my fuckin i ain't takin nuttin with it 
 the only place to me 
 out here doing dirt 
 screamin with my brothers on the 9 milla 
 when i'm on paper thin motherfuckers 
 drinkin gin 'fore youu get to lookin' 
 
 [chorus: 50 cent + 2pac)] 
 we gotta go let em know 
 i'm a slave to the real nigga the bricks niggas 
 and the dopeman had a nation 
 
 [tupac] 
 
 i'm cold from the casket 
 and why i fuck around 
 learn they got me under surveillance, that's what somebody be tellin 
 and now we a lying looking for some juice. 
 yeah but it's for life 
 fuck yo' enemies, nigga grip yo' nine tight, tonight's the day 
 the game will read the signs, i'm blind 
 it's like i'm all in 
 though we punch this 
 cut up and let him do it once..
