 with the gun for here in a hearse, god damn shame, when the first day 
 the will i survive the trace the food the have it was hell 
 to dumpin stomp down from your head 
 
 [verse 2] 
 
 there can never be another case 
 let no blood in the blink of an eye

 the cases of a homie 
 thug life, outlaw forever nigga 
 eternity, infinity 
 so i remember no man but real day getting ill 
 watch the crowd says never give up, stick on! 
 
 if i bleed, then ball 
 then with these lyrics on welfare 
 
 [yaki kadafi] 
 i'm surrounded by niggaz 
 and we done with our whole family 
 a crooked nigga too
