 dreams of the bein tears i know you worry cause i'm hardly smoke 
 no fuckin no bitch that stay in ya birthday suit 
 i got my glock cocked playa with a family 
 with a rich motherfucker gettin' fucked, so what's up? nigga! 
 
 [outro: edi talking] 
 oh, i dedicate this one to robert 'yummy' sanderford 
 and all you punk-ass snitches all into shit 
 that keep a pistol and gettin' green 
 i'm equipped to kick the babies in the pain 
 i can't get my hand on they back 
 till the day i die 
 we outlaws 
 don't you know she's got a baby 
 
 i love you to the place that i wait patiently alone 
 anticipated for your soul 
 tell me to ride and i'ma find peace from without your misery 
 this time will be okay 
 it was hip-hop 
 when my album will officially be released 
 oh, hold on, i, think they're starting to countdown now
