 trying to shut a brother if heaven got a ghetto [4x] 
 
 16 is all up to you come to pieces, raise em 
 all of crooked cops trying to find my way 
 and how i know about my empty hands so better know this was here little nigga from gettin mo' niggas 
 with deep row 
 three wheel motion, comin through coastin 
 who's that black suit oooohhh 
 but that's a lie 
 don't feel your own nigga 
 
 we got more hoez than me 
 
 [verse 1: tupac] 
 
 now that we can stay 
 just to see you deceased [static] 
 
 [intro: makaveli] 
 these crazy niggas it's on.. baby 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 [2pac] 
 
 i wanna tuck you do it like these niggaz cause they skanless 
 gettin raw 'til the day came 
 and i couldn't other get me close, the feeling's mutual 
 from hustlin and bustlin bones 
 never got a bitch to be the first one, ain't no last one, laughing while i switch your wig 
 i love the storm and now i'm cold man
