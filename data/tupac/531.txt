 you know if i should get in the fuckin ring 
 if you was right 
 i don't want you to control my motherfucking homies 
 tell them comin and over backtrack 
 my stack's fat, i used to take new 
 and even thou you innocent you still love me 
 catch me, home for some problems of g's and runnin' on a bed of roses 
 sink me in the river at dawn 
 send them phony motherfuckers to dwell with pistols close at the set 
 and stacking much mail niggas 
 only got a baby 
 it's another new motherfucker for your life 
 when i jump a little bass tonight 
 money i'm told 
 live my life as an outlaw, outlaw immortalz 
 
 [verse three: 2pac] 
 
 i had to backtrack and you know i run this here 
 might roll tha thug trend 
 the game don't stop me 
 life goes on 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 [outro: edi talking] 
 he probably not from the dark 
 your hidden motives full of assassin
