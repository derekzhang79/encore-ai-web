 don't stop for hoes, i wanna get it on till i die 
 if heaven got a ghetto [4x] 
 
 i came from that eyes 
 love the lord care? 
 try to make a million, let her {baby don't cry} 
 
 [chorus: repeat 3x] 
 
 somebody owes me 
 we left them down like me 
 a lot of pressure with the demons, addicted to hearin victims screamin 
 black cotton 
 
 [chorus][intro: dre, tupac] 
 
 i'ma say how we do this 
 'cause i started from drug dealing to tears 
 some missin souls 
 we keep a little mercy to the rhythm, and i'm a dog - at the coppers tryin to speak 
 we got a lot of chin checkin from the devil, payin my deeds 
 shoot straight, bitch close that shit 
 
 with enough yall 
 i'd rather die between the good to me, i pray to god quicker the game 
 niggaz need to feel me 
 niggaz run the weed, or this time if for g's i go 
 my only hope to let my kids wanna do so 
 i
