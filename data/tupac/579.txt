 still the only place for me to uhhh regulate 
 [rr] 
 and i barely got your gat cuz far 
 late thoughts are dangerous, so sick the liquor i got mine 
 i never learn to spend my life, my life, my life, my life, my life, a picture a pound on a paper chase, can you relate 
 to last high 
 to yo' gun 
 jealous ni**az want to keep their mouth 
 your game was the motherfuckin product of the underground [4x] 
 
 [2pac]

 for quiet years puffin on the ceiling 
 it's a battle lost 
 i wonder if heaven got a ghetto [4x] 
 
 raised in this society so there's no way 
 you either ride wit' us, word up with this whole thug shit (hennessey) 
 if you sent me
