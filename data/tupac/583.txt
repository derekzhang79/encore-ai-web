 she eating when i pull the fuckin ring 
 shinin back for your motherfuckin dope sack 
 kid it ain't easy, sleazy even since your homeboys ain't goin back 
 can't take a little bit of homeboys that remains, cause all the fine screams pierce the white car run the fuck 
 hurry the fuck you 
 you got my buddy lost his whole thugs 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 [verse 3] 
 
 we went from black 
 we was younger 
 i put a shot of that alazhay 
 come get me 'fore they hurt me 
 ran outta tears, 
 rest in peace, to cato, i've been born as an outlaw 
 so many young kids had to cry 
 but they aint down like tryin' to shut me 
 i'm coming ... 
 
 expect me nigga, like you expect jesus to come back 
 expect me nigga 
 i'm coming ...expect me nigga, like you expect jesus to come back 
 expect me nigga 
 i'm coming ... 
 
 expect me nigga, like you expect jesus to come back 
 expect me nigga 
 i'm coming ...expect me
