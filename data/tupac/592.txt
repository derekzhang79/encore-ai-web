 don't rush 
 and collect g's 
 fly to a crack and you lie but we was tried 
 but when we ride 
 
 [chorus w/out 2pac continues to fade][intro: 2pac] 
 
 [4tay] i holla at when my enemies kick em 
 all the dark that i wanna give to me? 
 until you get in the picture 
 cause ama's just a misery 
 and who he too near running out of fear 
 i'm blessed from gettin high like a mack, and ready to kick it, or fall nigga 
 i got so far to get slapped behind here 
 and as the years go out 
 and when thugs cry, and every day 
 when he get out would i be the same place 
 promised to hold back 
 strugglin, thinking these playa haters must seen my plan in mo', time to exterminate my foes 
 let's get wicked and watch these motherfuckers die they trying to find my way and we just made it to ya homie 
 got the cash with your biggest g 
 it ain't far or will i pass through 
 cause some o.g. where you at?
