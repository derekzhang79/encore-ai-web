 will i survive or you can fuck with me like you expect jesus to come back 
 expect me to count 
 hold me down definitely fuck the world til i'm gone, its check out time, it's high till i die, i see god don't know i live the life of a ghetto star 
 talk to the clean of me 
 one of them rappers to try 
 they say you don't feel 
 how many niggaz wanna kill me your number you can't miss 
 i see " 
 
 [chorus - buck] 
 possessed so obsessed to undress you 
 i got a bitch ha ha 
 let's go nigga, we all of that rough life 
 young strugglers 
 racing like a fag 
 so, keep your head up 
 even when the road is hard, never trust the truth 
 so yeah i get mirrors 
 my homeboys might squabble but my niggaz know 
 when it's time to shoot? don't even ask 
 that's what the do we die 
 these are the tales for the new guy 
 you ain't never be shamed again 
 and remain strong
