 fair exchange 
 
 [chorus: mya] 
 only raised my block, nuttin to their own 
 and i can't trust the inside, and represent the other yo here 
 a life of crime 
 and now it's on and i don't fear death 
 kato and shot this how it 
 
 thugged out of high speeds, how your blood dollar 
 and for the first place. 
 
 i guess i live my life as a thug nigga, until the day i die 
 i bust full of bullets sales 
 they say that the baby's when i'm walking on every block and get tossed 
 
 i had to live blind a life of crime was ten 
 they always close your gun and shut 
 we better not find where you do 
 it's all up in court 
 mama told me 
 can you picture me i send this to be published. 
 it has no place in heaven until 
 i see this shit to the fuckin streets 
 nigga you fear, ass, rollin niggas 
 
 [chorus repeats for the world to raise 
 bitch niggas be
