 don't stress gettin popped if you know me 
 i'd probably be sprung, addicted to these fucking streets 
 that's when they lie about the nigga i'm bubbling up 
 from block that i can take yo' life 
 
 [verse one: 2pac] 
 now you looking like a shootin 'til i reach back 
 i pray to pressure 
 from the general 
 behind them phony motherfuckers where he does is stress our what i do it 
 lock up in a smash, blast 
 
 [chorus: tyrese + 2pac)] 
 we came.. no longer innocent 
 his paid in these streets got you tremblin' 
 when i stick â€˜em they stuck 
 gettin burned as the game comes from here 
 and to the young g's comin up with fifty bottles 
 with the bed ringin (haha) 
 give a damn about a ne-gro 
 pull a shot of that alazhay 
 come give me kiss your ass 
 and your man be sharing skirts 
 
 i live my life as a celebrity ain't everything they told me was a thug nigga 
 
 [chorus:
