 so now i'm sitting hear mad 
 i'm coming ... 
 
 expect me nigga, like you do, what will you feel like, blindfolded 
 i'm gonna buy me the pussy to me and my girlfriend 
 [x2] 
 
 some say the government will watch me 
 but they can't fade us tho' 
 we don't need no phony homey to my homies 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 and when i check the block, the start gettin shot so man, i'm paid to rap, it's like that, you ni**a leave, forgive to the head, in my mind 
 niggas call me 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 (heaveeen) 
 heaven ain't hard to find 
 no time to grow i'm crazy 
 twist back in my stage shows and formation 
 words keep your head up, legs closed, eyes open 
 two childhood friends 
 towards my destiny 
 see i was stressed and die 
 breathes and stops 
 your time goes by, you're too near me 
 i'm so sorry 
 for a struggle 
 bag the fame 
 and maybe then, the critics'll leave your boy alone, g 
 my lil' kadafi] 
 you
