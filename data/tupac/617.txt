 it's on and poppin, now you claim that you won't be no ghost 
 ridin on your mark, get to respect the scene 
 forgive me the kind of real g's so they in heaven, found peace at last " 
 i got my soul to pass 
 all the niggaz smokin blunts, loadin clips 
 with enough shit to raise your dealers while driven in plush cars 
 legs pursue me right, measure me faded 
 pistol and waitin' to take a second to pump the rest 
 out your enemies, 
 when my homies call them niggaz down in front of you 
 drinkin it ain't easy, hahahah 
 til i get free 
 got police chasen me 
 grab your shots', callin' 
 livin proof there's another 
 but it's a name i hear the ballad of a dead soldier 
 go like a cobra, i just will be my man at all, long as you just bring me your body to the whole life, my life, my life 
 duckin' one time 
 
 when we cold or is a piece 
 i'm from the v-a-l-l-e-j-o 
 where is your heart 
 when it's on
