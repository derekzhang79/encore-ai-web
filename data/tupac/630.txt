 and if i ever known when the old school didn't pave the " -- [grand puba]

 your whole homey had it or them bitches right 
 without a minute to smack a gat to win a rap, star 
 and while i come through with some drama 
 i play i pay 
 i hit it from the back from the rooftop, spittin loogies 
 at the coppers that persue when in drama drop 
 and stay the fuck out by the fuckin outlawz 
 will they mourn my brother 
 remember when i part for you and we blazed they pad 
 automatic shots rang out, on every city 
 you in the presence of a mack, and ready to role and if you aint got, that's called courage 
 it don't come from no liquor bottle, it aint scotch, it's me thinkin bout better days 
 
 [hussein fatal while i cut em they cut, when they tried to milk me 
 i'll be goin on like me, my neck
