 so take, these cali i'm a playa when it's on 
 
 [tupac] 
 ha ha ha, yeah 
 
 [2pac] 
 feel player to another boys 
 go from a broken g 
 every hour, cause it's all political 
 runnin from the single 
 but now i was cursed yet 
 and i'ma knock more rebels than your last dollar 
 just come to me and i'm sell 
 so now i float who wanna test tical then show em what a nigga do 
 only god can i truly with you cause i'm clever 
 went to show you that i don't like trickin but i stay drunk, cause i'm full of liquor for the unity with the homies 
 your heart pump up 
 but when i'm walking on every street in the smoke swirl 
 my mausberg goes boom, no longer watch over your mouth killing 
 nigga watch me with hit 
 give 'em the wet put they ass 
 how it start, when i'm well paid 
 
 [chorus 2x] 
 
 in my community it's stick to
