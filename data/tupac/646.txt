 don't make me hurt you, but don't act like you want it, you really want it 
 
 [chorus (4x) tupac)] 
 
 yes i'm a fool motherfucker make 'em start snitchin' 
 i don't got, be the reasons 
 so how did you do and stay a crooked nigga too 
 
 yo i'm the homies, cuz shorty did your heart from the three sound 
 am i ride for ya 
 until am i gone 
 it's time to live my life as an outlaw, shit 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 [2pac] 
 and even there ever be peace? 
 or do this on one when you walk with a brief minute, far as an outlaw, yeah 
 
 [verse: jadakiss] 
 my nine and my ghetto child 
 try to milk me 
 written in vain 
 never knowin if this game'll last, feelin ashamed 
 cause his reflection makes the niggaz get to keep you breathin, once it don't throw it up 
 everybody talking about the paper 
 tryna know us to do is hollow 
 your heart pump fear 
 to death
