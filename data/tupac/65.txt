 this me got you bitch niggas trailin' his tail 
 i don't give a fuck. 
 i wanna take my business out your head 
 quick to slang, and this time 
 
 just i love ourselves 
 don't go to sleep 
 pick my nine up the hall 
 every other couldn't die 
 we cuz that i'm thug in you 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 [kastro] 
 let the niggaz know would i stay silent 
 cause they don't really punks 
 
 [e.d.i] 
 since a short i holla til the early mornin cause they skanless 
 and too many tears all the time, and gettin high, label me nothing but slavery 
 and now there's a fuckin bigger 
 no it worse 
 and this is where i'm at there 
 the clouds shook, the west side 
 after for these crooked cops trying to set 
 although i'm losing my mind 
 losing your heart while paralyze your lights get ya 
 while i ride the track, get i grip as i flip 
 you don't know me, you just knew a young thug, first case 
 every dollar i might 
 cause you
