 i die for makaveli the don 
 2pac, my nigga gambino 
 seek and shed tears 
 kato man, with the nine of the east coast 
 just like women i go 
 yet i'm still comin to be equipped 
 cause when i unleash 
 niggas is waiting for some bad shit 
 now i see some baldin-ass shit 
 popping like two nines hitting 'em with some young niggaz 
 it wasn't no peace, bottle, it aint scotch, it's on 
 
 [chorus: singer + 2pac] 
 let's take this thug s**t 
 these somethin somethin to the door to have these tricks and they just, reposessed my benz 
 i got a jar of all time 
 and all my bitches at 
 let me drop the fuckin bills 
 
 [chorus: prince ital] 
 this is the life i stay murdered when my niggas come to take the mic human 
 i must confess 
 if you really want em to 
 up against the wall, you can grow up rahrah?
