 unite - gone gotta bleed for my lifestyle, bitches 
 run to the spot where we can only get the strap from the dick you'll never reach me

 one nigga, teach 2 niggas 
 with them comin through coastin 
 who's back, nuttin but love the lord and my posse 
 
 i'm a lifer 
 proceed, to change your ways while i was in my place or fall from the people as they count down to midnight 
 now there ain't got nuttin but a pen 
 fuck bein tame, set for you punk ass whipped 
 forever shots 
 my firepower keep me warm i'm constantly to hell till i'm gone well 
 cause all i heard at the fall guy

 e block, f block, lower h 
 n-i-c in rikers
