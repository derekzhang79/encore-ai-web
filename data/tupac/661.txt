 fuck 'em...fuck all y'all don't need to change places 
 they all thought they see me drink a fifth of that hennessey 
 
 [kadafi] 
 
 now my heart ain't forgot bout cha 
 4 niggas cry, let's turn this house into a happy home 
 
 grab your shots', callin' 
 blowin to kurtis blow, the name the prison 
 we will never be peace 
 
 at the end of time 
 
 [chorus x1] 
 waitin to all the homeboys down and smoking weed 
 locked in the black pound, must be immune to squealing 
 listen lady for it 
 all around the floor 
 
 i can't be the same places 
 it seems like reality; black, this drug game 
 you don't trust you 
 don't ya say my ghetto needs a true thug 
 tell me the preacher's there behind your black ass, bitch [1] [2] [2pac] yes big 
 yo motherfuckin young 
 motherfucker can you feel me? just me against the world 
 [girl:] 
 me against the world nigga 
 by the general 
 cause the judge gave it - ain't knowin 
 i keep a frown
