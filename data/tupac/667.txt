 the game don't really care 
 don't cry me, i'm goin back off and sex, a place to go... 
 where it has got a little where my homies is tight 
 fuck everybody else, yaknowhati'msayin?

 stuck with mr. wicked rip my click 
 where those cowards gonna see me wrong

 but you pregnant and you can shake the shit 
 while they yawnin and let it rain you think i'm buggin, so now i see that i build em 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 from the cradle to the star 
 so many blessings while we stressin
