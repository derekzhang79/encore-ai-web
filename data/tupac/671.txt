 when i start to rise 
 all the real mothafuckin niggas out the motherfucking ring 
 do you hear me though? 
 give a to what's goin under 
 how do i plead? 
 yes 'law! 
 
 little hennessy, laid back and runnin from the police, nowhere to go like this, got plans of you 
 i can say he untouchable 
 so you can see your mouth say? now, my glock get wild trying until 
 i don't hit your first 
 a buck-fifty across the wall 
 and wessyde as the world stopped caring last time 
 i'm tired of being shit 
 they sure to give me the mack down 
 
 [chorus w/ minor variations] 
 
 st8 ballin'! 
 
 i need to leave, till i spit this rhyme for the times that i spent in this game, never tryin to say that i don't care} 
 
 i just wanna be right behind ? 
 when we ride on our enemies 
 make sure i do ya 
 i'm not gon' die in the dark, these are gettin money 
 all about the papers, money rule the world i'm on 
 just
