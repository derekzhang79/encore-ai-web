 i came to my block 
 
 [2pac] 
 this go out to all the rest 
 niggas make my homies in the city 
 bitches made they hands all not to trust the bitch from us 
 yo why you wanna stop me 
 your hidden motives full of passion 
 and test 
 keep trying nigga, keep trying nigga 
 thug life, outlaw forever nigga 
 eternity, infinity 
 so remember makaveli the don 
 his thug life lives on[big syke] 
 thug life, microphone across 
 and there's another 
 and to myself 
 the need make my life, most of these niggaz that they cant mock you nigga, what ya play 
 nigga we got you, got you crazy 
 all the rest till these motherfuckers shot up from the slums, made it out my mom's house, got a pound on the trigger, for stroked 
 and all the other real g's that beat it 
 done lost too many drugs what you're seeing 
 i'm glad to let the movie fool me 
 so they placed me in the river at dawn 
 send me away with the cops 
 
 [chorus 2x]
