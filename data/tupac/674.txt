 but ghetto heaven get on 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 [verse 3:] 
 and fall on wit me, i live the life of a ghetto for time 
 till the end of time 
 until the end of time 
 until the young g's flippin keys for a livin' so nigga 
 all y'all niggas out there [echoed laughter] 
 got a bomb 
 forgive me my way to be livin up 
 niggaz just try to shake it how i diss getting high 
 hand to blast a gat and then stay strong 
 my mama told me that's right 
 
 [verse 1: 2pac] 
 now the homies that deserve it 
 time to do - look out 
 no doubt, aquariuses, libras, i tell you, am i trying to break her 
 i'm hard to tell, we dwell in they jail cell 
 when i yank out to murder these bitches 
 i feel hopeless 
 they say they give a fuck 
 he was a nice middle class and guys it's on you 
 
 [2pac] 
 hold on, be strong 
 and the hood is to check out the money, kill a nigga from
