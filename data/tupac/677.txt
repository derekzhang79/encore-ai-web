 i see death in no time at all 
 i'm high till i die 
 when em' stupid ass bitches ask me about my history i want to see the maniac psychopath 
 we won't stop, i done roll blind 
 no one knows my struggle, money put in work 
 tired of being coming to another soul 
 we not know i 
 turn to her grave 
 thug for life scrawled all across the wall 
 but having respect, that feels to do shit 
 you tell me i know 
 you catch my nigga, but it's a battle 
 just thugs as 50 
 i've been caught in cops ass, blast sweet 
 gettin' hotter now calm down get the money out tha murder scene 
 am i jet thug passion 
 i don't care of my passion, how long i will go 
 how do i go 
 iâ€™ll be death to makaveli 
 if the rest of you in 
 the next door neighbor's havin convo with undercovers 
 put your hands to your thug life niggas 
 i'll be stressed and take gloves 
 down in this bi**h, worldwide mash, westside 
 makaveli
