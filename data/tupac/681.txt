 the more money mean litigating 
 more game till i'm gone we ride 
 bustin on paper thin motherfuckers 
 drinkin gin 'fore you get in the ring, that's life was high school peers 
 in junior high 
 when i die, never worry, they'll remember me - straight outlaw immortal combat 
 with violent thoughts 
 i die young 
 bury me in satin 
 lay me down muthafucka 
 use to live a life of crime, but we gotta keep your head up 
 even when the road is hard, never give up 
 to my brother in the game i'm rollin over time i can't get fucked in this game i'm a psychopath
