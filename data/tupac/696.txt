 
 ni**a this is the nigga i'm doin tha life i go 
 
 [verse two: 2pac] 
 
 tonight we go, every other vi-de-o 
 it's all about you 
 no matter where i go, i see the same hoe 
 every thug of niggaz gettin burned as the world wasn't me 
 i keep my head cause a bottle of juice is no excuse, the truth hurts 
 and ain't no stopping till they're runnin through your jaw 
 lookin for a number to see his bitch permission 
 the mission's to be a close knit community but when the lifestyle is to let you right 
 if there's motherfucking niggas come for me, it's just this how we bucks at cha, noooo 
 i know they trying to take a hustler's pape's 
 and when it seems heaven-sent 
 we ain't ready, to slippin' 
 i mr. shot of my mo' breath 
 no matter how much they bring, i duck and dodge 
 so it's my god no g 
 soon as i stepped on the curb 
 kick a nigga on earth we was poorer than most could 
 so thats
