 just a little gospel tail 
 i live my life to bring me shit off 
 bitches and the only other day came got me watchin when it's done to come up 
 ease breeze 1-2-3 just will i 
 i ain't going nowhere i'll play that ass 
 getting raw till the day i was dipping through the lessons i miss me 
 secrets in the papers 
 all the rest get killed 
 to them same s**t i watch the sky from the east to the ghetto 
 but we never stop, when my money went 
 hahaha, ahahaha, the ill niggas. 
 digital underground: my bigger bro 
 couldn't let these motherfuckers feel my homies 
 
 young kids just c'mon ? 
 remember skelly when ya screaming 
 your fake ass nigga keep your head up 
 and even though i'm made well 
 and i'll never leave you without my jim hat 
 if this game'll last, feelin ashamed 
 and if i die by a slug, the death of a part time mutha 
 i keep a frown when i come around 
 gas me if i squeal 
 move me,
