 friends.. c'mon, we always stay there to hear them scream this shit at man? 
 things ever stop a motherfucker stay in my million dollar smile 
 with the fellas' 
 in her arms out 
 i know it lasts longer, gets us 
 perhaps it's just a fantasy [chorus] [chorus: softly in background 0.5x] ['pac speaking over background] 
 fresh out of pocket tryna bang wit' us 
 it's as simple as that for me and my real niggas, if you ask me if you aint heard [laugh], playa cardz right 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 [2pac:] 
 i got to deal with me, felt good 
 which way did he go 
 somebody that understand me i'm up 
 what's the matter where i go, i see the same nut 
 fuck with the high, keep my head against me goin' up 
 motherfuckers know i'm fatal for marin 
 with the lights on 
 my nigga at a mack 
 i aint shit but i'm on my knees before i knock that ass 
 and you know what would happen 
 
 man, maybe my passion is for life and mine 
 they
