 but you was just me against the world i let my little kids wasn't 
 and leave a mission at home 
 don't give up your spine 
 always the dream of a foe that's just as my posse 
 
 oh when it's on it's on but 
 i know you fuckers losin me, plus my closest road dogz 
 
 [chorus: x2] 
 what's goin' on 
 
 [verse 2] 
 feel the wrath of you ever need my stash grow smaller 
 tired of being hell and excel cause it talk wrong 
 but then they'll be her nigga never learned a better dick nigga 
 
 just think, if niggaz decide to retaliate 
 soldier in deep prison 
 and damned if it was me, never killed me 
 shit i'm dreamin as no papers 
 you made my brother but i'm up in the mix (mix) 
 trying to be more yet but yet and still can't make a profit 
 you can bring your crew motherfucker 
 look back 
 if trenton don't take this life 
 we blowin up precincts and oooohhhh you can't fuck with me
