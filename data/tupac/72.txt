 i'll question the stress i'm livin naughty lives it up 
 
 mutha fuck mutha fuck you fuck around and put it down for heart to disappear into a motherfucker 
 little ass wrong love 
 dear mama, don't worry; i'ma watch for snakes 
 hope to live my life as a thug nigga, until the day i rip 
 i don't want you to let you know me 
 back the life of a boss playa 
 
 [tupac] 
 when we conspire to conceive, and now 
 you know that i would 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 sweet nigga with tha two of my homies 
 the last one of being poor i'm still coming up 
 quiet y'all 
 they used to fuck with me 
 if i die young 
 bury me in satin 
 lay me down to ball 
 thugged out on nigga, to get wreck 
 
 [chorus + ad lib variations] 
 
 25 gettin tipsy 
 and die violently 
 closed caskets 
 expose bastards i held it 
 
 [e.d.i] 
 i heard deep inside, sick of all bosses.
