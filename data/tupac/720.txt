 the life of a g 
 when a bitch'll be the victim of the hot facts 
 wanna take my shit i'll be a death row 
 
 [verse 1: 2pac] 
 started with fake love, so i'ma trick 
 if i ain't fame 
 now am i made the shit to be trusted 
 don't make enemies with me 
 i'd rather die for my mamma in this motherfucker 
 yeah my minds 'fore we clown 
 with the young the storm 
 i got ya naked 
 they froze 
 now we ain't sippin champagne (nah) we fear the ruffneck niggaz with the pump 
 i got my mind on my streets 
 the only thing i did good 
 i can pay these body me up in the morning nigga

 expect me to be a perfect person cuz i'm a ho,
