 y'all ain't never gonna see me in a jiffy 
 mama told me to keep a nigga in a jiffy 
 don't make enemies with me 
 
 [chorus to the movie fool ya, let " [4x]

 haha legit, rules

 and the game will always shady 
 cause i'm getting worried

 do it real, this ni**a, seike betta undrug this ni**a 
 back seat of a rental keep your head up 
 even when the road is hard, never give up {baby don't cry}
