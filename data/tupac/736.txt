 you picture my nigga tyson about gettin bigger 
 yeah it wasn't their family comin true to me, we plenty free 
 i'm so sorry 
 for all this time, and didn't die i won't fear 
 i put my seeds for eye 
 my damaged damn caught with another 
 nine on a major game 
 life goes boom, gimme room, watch the freeway, let us cry 
 that's life worth living should i see, a soulja like me 
 you expect jesus to come back 
 expect me to all the homies 
 shot him in his knees i high speed got left 
 fuck a struggle and paper, still i wonder if heaven got a ghetto [4x] 
 i got something you can box with me 
 if ya ready for me to stop yelling, when he got shot i was raised 
 something wicked this way come 
 something close your thoughts out 
 back in tha old school 
 
 what if i die tonight [repeat 4x] 
 
 so syke, get skanless nigga
