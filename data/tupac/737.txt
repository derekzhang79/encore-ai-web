 i wanna stop the killin 
 just search your feelings, participate in the funk house' buster you'll play the nigga with they lyrics 
 hard on a time. facing 
 lookin like thugs wanted and you'll find you by a coffin 
 i'm a do whatever i like. i am not a lost soul 
 and you'll get bad ass nigga, you know? 
 i live the life of a ghetto star 
 
 [nutt-so:] 
 my plan is to live a beef with me 
 me and my enemies not knowing i'm coming through my sight 
 i got my game about women from a prostitute 
 and still clown with the underground, i don't think i'll die if i do you hear us have it 
 love for eachother 
 so i can't help but hear ya oh 
 little ceas' 
 now they all know me 
 my life is lil' mo was gonna come to, give it, i'm a mack 
 
 i got nothin' to lose, i wish it was a kilo 
 i wonder if heaven got a ghetto [4x] 
 
 [chorus 4x] 
 
 while the hog 
 i got energy
