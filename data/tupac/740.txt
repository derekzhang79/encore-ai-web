 till i'm gone, biatch!

 fuck all the things on tv, believe me 
 if you sent me 
 i got my killers on the mutha fuckin' house 
 tupac's in the mutha fuckin' house 
 tupac's in the mutha fuckin' house 
 tupac's in the mutha fuckin' house 
 this how we still slave 
 
 [tupac straight - a little extra stressin 
 a spot where we belong, get a ticket cause i'm rappin don't be alarmed 
 i heard my part jealous kids too 
 
 [tupac]

 [chorus x2][2pac:] 
 damn, where did i fail? 
 and my nigga, now i'm on my friends 
 promised to watch your heart, now i could understand me 
 when everybody's sleeping 
 i learn to cheer me 
 i'm good niggaz now 
 when mama's just a red rum, leaving the young thugs, the have-nots you know 
 the hating will never seen with my two case 
 the realest motherfucker that i can't take 
 god don't cry
