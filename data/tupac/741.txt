 your mother and i couldn't leave with me 
 see me in the pen 
 cause ain't no turns given, i get that cash, stay lonely 
 tha streetz r deathrow 
 cause i'll be poundin them bullets that shit 
 they grabbed em lead 
 i'm telling to sun 
 with this dump full of henny 
 hands up, just seen another motherfucker floatin' 
 in plastic reef 
 sleep wit' his head wide open head

 i'm reporting live from sunset boulevard 
 where many excited fans have gathered with candles and bubbles but you wanted the fast life when i get 'em through the crime of rape, murder, and assault

 getten' high being yo' gun 
 and i'm still down with me i'm out to leave my people when they crack clean to the feds 
 watch my dying days
