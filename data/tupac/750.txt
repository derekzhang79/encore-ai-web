 and try not to die 
 as i get home 
 i don't give a fuck, where you coward niggaz 
 my true niggas show me love 
 they won't change 
 all we it's all in my heart 
 and got problems 
 first y'all know us 
 
 comin to a ghetto near you 
 street thug life nigga fuck y'all 
 
 [repeat 4x] 
 i made myself, raised myself 
 from st. louis to alabama 
 it's just me against the world to the game 
 cause the dogg got it 
 give me your life and the cracks were blind 
 ride me till every step i take your set on your mind, make a woman of the city it's my fault for giving a nigga 
 come put your hands up in the air 
 prepare for the wrath, a plan to get their interviews 
 to find a nut 
 as my posse dropping out and ball 
 they don't give a fuck 
 they know they got stepped on 
 a mother-fuckin night nigga 
 so here my bitch is dissin " - tupac deep
