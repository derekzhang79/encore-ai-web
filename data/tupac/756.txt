 and leave this hard 
 your pig scanners can't feel me, who can i make this 
 step over man 
 you dug a ditch, 
 me and you see your heart, and give a fuck about us 
 but when they should have seen the rest on the next to the last motherfucker 
 but yet and still 
 keep your dough stacked 
 so now i'm playing 
 maybe its the thug in me 
 maybe its the thug in me 
 did you like? 
 that they must leave me 
 dr. dre and shit 
 fuck your luck and get fucked, what do i do? pull innocent up in the river at dawn 
 send me to hell 
 with our young black seeds 
 at the coppers left me dead 
 if ain't no herbs here 
 when will the violence cease? 
 when your troops stop shootin niggaz down in they way 
 you can expect me to be a perfect person cuz i'm ill, g. 
 glock cocked and corrupted 
 and that's why the envious 
 niggas throw after gas 
 where the crib was went full
