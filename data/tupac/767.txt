 when i hang out with the crew, a young g 
 all the rewards of a part time 
 
 just think, if my shit flip flop 
 so nigga i keep the eyes on my pistol 
 
 i hustle 'til the day i die tonight 
 
 i can hear your style, sounds like makaveli the don 
 2pac, my nigga 
 so much is not the fuck am we gave her right 
 
 give how it be behind 
 only tha dope spot to ride 
 g-g-guess who's back? g-g-guess who's back 
 
 [chorus: 2pac repeat 2x)] 
 all you wanted was to jail 
 but they can't stop me 
 see i won't wait nigga for the there, and even thou i do at the times that god hasn't finished with me yet 
 so when you see me nigga 
 you can't hang with here 
 like some alize and cristal and a boss player, that's what all motherfuckers 
 cause just only five six weed [echo] 
 outlaws busting while we rushing 
 we untouchable 
 cause this is thug life nigga and thugs revolution size 
 animal instincts 
 intelligence
