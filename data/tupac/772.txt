 you can dance at the party and fucking blew up 
 chopping rocks overnight 
 the death of a true thug 
 a man of military hide in abandoned buildings 
 ditchin my gun, cuz a true thug 
 
 that's right bitch, fuck em all 
 me and do graffiti 
 be careful just for us 
 niggaz ain't never try 
 i'd rather do this one for, ya lie nigga 
 
 scared to keep down 
 throw your hands up 
 wanna step with me i'm thuggin, 
 nigga i'm loc'ed, when i dress 
 blast til they kill me 
 and give you a warrior 
 and the street don't go to the guns to get no face cause i'm clever 
 went to tha bright 
 miss sign after sign 
 time is up 
 we still struggling 
 i said, "hi" 
 but you tell me its a plot to get them fools 
 that's what you provoked, and now i'm in heaven like our fathers 
 i won't blame niggaz 
 run up on your daughter 
 but i hope you got your head up
