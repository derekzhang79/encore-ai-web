 dred, jheri curl, process, or bald 
 or watch the bitches scream 
 when the young thugs 
 straight hustlas, caught up in the streets from the county and i'm on my hair if you gave me we riot 
 eating jack mat 
 staring at my mind 
 never saw no real refuse no more niggas on the street 
 on these bitches they still continue to pursue me 
 i got my back against i'm right hand 
 i'm still him for the thug years 
 them are runnin by the police and arrested 
 niggaz need to know shit 
 smoking nigga i'll be in the name 
 mama checking up in the back streets 
 never beatin my pros 
 mashin like a paranoid man through all every punk though 
 he don't sweat varmits 
 i load your hand on your muthafuckin ride 
 
 [chorus x2: krayzie bone & tupac] 
 it's life after day, plus the media be crucifying brothers severly them see me 
 it was just a no matter where i go, i see the same bitch was street 
 i need help you know your black ass,
