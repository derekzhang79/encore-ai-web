 where many people we are unstoppable 
 and uhh, i'm not goin alive! keep trying nigga 
 thug life, outlaw forever nigga 
 eternity, infinity 
 so remember makaveli the don 
 2pac, my niggaz flippin chips 
 gettin lame in the storm 
 fuck the world till i'm gone 
 no more livin but i'm it prophecy? 
 fresh out of mine 
 i watch my back twenty-fo' seven 
 and even thou you innocent i don't want it 
 lost before i get around 
 cause why i be ballin, don't

 tell 'em about this life 
 like even left the sun 
 please take care till you gone 
 cause i'm playing to win, and survive 
 the money and the fame made to work with the band 
 trying to shake, the crates and pain 
 
 i was wanted to blood cause i hear the sirens, seen him murdered in this capitalistic cell 
 the teflon's make the beat of that alazhay 
 fuck you losers, 
 while i'm troublesome
