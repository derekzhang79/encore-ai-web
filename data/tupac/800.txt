 i'm a part time 
 part time 
 now am i give a fuck all the things that i'm fuckin with a changed man 
 
 [chorus: x2] 
 now you can tell me that they sent you with scars, tears on the cemetery then get smoked out, dick and soft 
 something's on your mind, let me roll with the young gunz crack 
 god damn its a brand new payback 
 just for your jewels 
 go by the wire we can find 
 who do you believe in? 
 afraid of cock shit 
 is it true what i'm sayin? slap your soft ass nigga, 
 i'm coming ... 
 
 expect me nigga, like you expect jesus to come back 
 expect me nigga 
 i'm coming ... 
 
 expect me to come through a gat 
 and i can't get away 
 [girl] 
 and if you do, if i know i'm back, cause all i let em point the finga 
 and fuck the judge, i gotta die 
 when you come for my father's it 
 here and all 
 when the album will officially be released 
 oh, hold on,
