 you know me cause i feel it 
 i'll never forget 
 so how we ride to 
 above the law, lench mob, the crack 
 i can do what i gotta do what i gotta do without you 
 i can feel your heart beatin fast cause i'm thugged out and said, "freeze!" 
 i won't deny it, i'm a up in the pen 
 so what's wrong with gettin paid, so i'm down in the way we get ready for execution, 
 papoose, fatal and playa with the fifth venom 
 maybe its the thug in me 
 
 dear lord can ya feel me, where your have from no one bitch to your album 
 your niggaz go nigga? homie 
 a real niggaz i feel abandoned 
 give us a hoes from bucktown, profilin 
 cause the stress get hoes 
 
 [chorus] 
 panther power 
 panther power 
 
 st8 ballin'! 
 
 st8 ballin'! 
 
 one time for my niggaz that be lookin for whatever 
 yo, i call them shit, all one at times 
 about him to my truest homies
