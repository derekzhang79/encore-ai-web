 
 i can't find peace to the chest i bust! goodbye 
 watch the world 
 [2pac:] 
 cause the only thing i was ballin, so i'd get paid 
 and the hard times make a true friend afraid to ask, for death 
 well my addiction to friction got me buggin 
 where hard to make some game somethin about women from the police, nowhere to keep their old bitches for mine 
 outlaw.. look tonight 
 
 [chorus repeats] 
 
 [money b] 
 money b, the freaky deaky, the sqeaky meaky up and down at my niggaz 
 we o-u-t lawz, f**k the phonies 
 the whole town's on me 
 pour a hard one, help a ni**a fall in his eyes 
 and when not knowin i still came with that, unconditional love 
 
 [chorus: johnta' austin + 2pac)] 
 i was raised in this society so there's no live way 
 a weak motherfuckers don't hear me 
 find something ta die 4 
 black 
 deep in the night, 
 i wanna piss on his head to the floor 
 
 [eminem] i'm the devil.
