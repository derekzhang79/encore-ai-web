 we takin over, cause i'ma ride

 when they scrappin'

 hearin' thoughts of my misery 
 never meant to live 
 lonely with the law

 i'm the only place for me that never love me

 be trying to roll up in this s**t for your wifes body off of time

 cause i live the life of a love cuz i murder you then i, run this shit!
