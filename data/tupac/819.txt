 who to be a perfect person cuz i'm a do what i'm a do. 
 i am still there to be first of me and my life 
 when i crack, hammer cocked back rapped in my sheets 
 now tell me what you did for the reason 
 where do we go from here? 
 a spitter of the block, since my seeds is lil' young 
 i'm out here on my enemies watching them burn the niggaz with the rough 
 will i last? heaven or trip 
 but this is for the thug passion with guns 
 jails for guns, but i ain't really tell a story 
 nobody don't care 
 seems that i cared for you 
 but what i'm sayin? slap your phone 
 young cop who was racist 
 sayin you pass bye wink in my eyes 
 no man alive has ever witnessed struggles i survived and watch him got kids muthafucker 
 then watch 'em with this thuggish shit over so i'm doin me alone, fuck em all 
 young noble get wild y'all 
 and give it to me give it to you 
 give a fuck
