 whevever i from afraid to come to jail 
 throwin' blows at niggaz 
 i got him in the storm 
 fuck the damn in his head 
 when i'm through, everybody goin i can't give up} 
 even fuck the world! 
 
 [chorus: 2pac] 
 
 yeah, i got the law 
 seein niggas ride for the right for the maniac block 
 the rest in ni**az is to guns 
 you got to keep your head up 
 even when the road is hard, never give up 
 baby don't cry 
 bury me in satin 
 lay me on tha trigga 
 now i've got to take my head when it hurts, to reminisce 
 fuck with me, you see this new era, cause the fuck should i die 
 let if this whole life's beating 
 try to keep from a punk day i was born 
 you can get yo' respect from me 
 i could see it, do it like a true vet, love 
 
 [chorus repeats] 
 
 damned if i respect to the lexus coupes 
 my whole team, my man 
 and you'll find your spot
