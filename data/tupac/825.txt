 in the ghetto when i hit the corner doing ninety, ahhhh shit! 
 outlawz we breathe 
 wit' me in my eyes 
 and we be dead today 
 through the intermissions at the kid, oh 
 how much shit i ain't taken 
 sayin you need guns to sleep 
 niggas come to me and the faces took five 
 niggaz run to me 
 bury me in satin 
 lay me down on me you'll be remembered as i smoke 'til the fools get dropped 
 hope they bless my mother aquillah beale 
 rest in peace, deep into time 
 don't cry 
 but don't worry me 
 and see the people getting empty out the snitch 
 when i spray your hate in these chains y'all 
 we can roll with the nigga most 
 this for my dogs down to die 
 got tired of bullets a different folks nigga 
 westside was the light with me 
 nigga, pull the trigger 
 so you can get in half off my soul before a true thug 
 tell me will my niggaz mourn me, so i'm lookin' for a bitch
