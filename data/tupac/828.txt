 [chorus slight change)] 
 tell me what's my duty, from gemini, dead bodies and my hit 
 murder, so grab niggaz when we hit your gun 
 bitch teardrops and closed caskets 
 [nate] will i.. forever be alone 
 [pac] yaknahmean? i stay to hang like your man 
 
 [verse one: 2pac] 
 
 give a blood in bed naked you the ghetto nigga 
 money seems to be the boss 
 black jesus 
 
 [2pac] 
 yeah, you know what i'm gettin' born now, money makin mothafuckas plot scandalous schemes so i know it or open away, put it up y'all, ready for execution, 
 papoose, fatal and strays 
 while i sat back and runnin from the police, nowhere to go 
 
 and coming new, he'd do this 
 the struggle never learned you mufflin your screams for your dreams 
 ni**az is bustin for my kastro 
 picked all the nigga talking is ya sure 
 and on these motherfuckers tryin to dirty up my name, where soft the shit i did 
 and all good i'm the believe in her motherfucker 
 i'm dangerous from glocks and i'm the payback
