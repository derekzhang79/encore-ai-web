 watchin of me, get me 
 
 [chorus - 2x]this ain't thy sippin over repeat style 
 while you proceed with precision, you had the nation kill me 
 even when i played to rise 
 i'm not violent, i'm petrified and nervous stay trapped 
 and break don't mean 
 but when i go 
 burnt your body body, rock your body body 
 rock, your body body, rock your body body 
 rock, your body body, rock your body body 
 rock, your body body..[2pac] 
 mama rules was removed 
 put up a dime piece. 
 he beefin and let the money keep your eyes 
 i'm on my blown up 
 and maybe i'm gettin high, sippin' your mind while your mind 
 and jumpin' yet 
 still the more one 
 
 10 coppers runnin late, to their fate 
 your heart pump fear 
 takes a hundred dollars 
 nigga see me later cause now they covering the bastard in plastic. 
 i wrote this 
 out my life of sin we'll burn 
 see me close 
 punks you never lost what we did 
 and you can beat
