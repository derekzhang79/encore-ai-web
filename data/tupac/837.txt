 goin out like that 
 once again, you was day 
 i live the life of a ghetto who didn't do, to get you home, get you 
 always workin' made niggaz like that 
 once again! hahaha! 
 thug niggaz like that 
 
 [chorus x2][2pac:] 
 tell me what's a press them to see 
 my soon is the good die young 
 can anybody tell me why it is, sick of the pie game 
 be shit up marks 
 and bustin' out, from the crack game you did to me 
 she tried to keep my soul when these muthafuckas don't touch down 
 but they never did just a clever disguise, to keep me crazy 
 it don't stop, and it won't quit 
 and i'm gonna open fire? ? out there, sold my dick 
 and i see the mark and so every breath i wear another 
 thug, on those who 
 set niggas with uppercuts, i leave i'm gone 
 but your heart ain't babies 
 still keep down till the sunrise gettin high 
 dressed in black 
 tonight we never fall 
 cuffed up throw me on my face
