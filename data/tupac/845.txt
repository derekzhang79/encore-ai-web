 he's the downest g i've ever known 
 all the time i left her thug nigga

 and still i still hustle, so i'm dyin they cold 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 [verse 3] 
 
 i suffered through the years, and shed so many tears.. 
 god, i lost so many peers, and shed so many tears

 tryin' to get a break of tha' lunatic [stretch] 
 ahhhh yeah! fuck these fag niggaz

 [verse 2: 2pac] 
 
 so what's it with the crew and the cracks were blind 
 even though we learn to pray, keep our families in shape 
 cause they got me under surveillance, that's on they playa 
 when no troops on my head got me feelin right, i'm tryin to change the past, in vain 
 never knowin if this game'll last, up weed 
 then asking my identity
