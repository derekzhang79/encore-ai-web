 i'm on my way and i know 
 y'all dont know that hard of shit about so much pain 
 stuck in this game 
 searching for fortune and fame 
 
 [verse 4: kurupt] 
 animal instinct cannibal handheld 
 devour multitudes from rapid fire on the curb one when the cops come arrest me in a flow 
 and you was, 'ready to die' 
 motherfucker we left him 
 if they get dumped like 3's, with 57 wasted at this motherfucker's 
 we'll see the mark in the days of a bitch 
 and if you really want it 
 if, you move and if you lick me right, please eat a dick up. my niggaz get to control my strap 
 locate my comrades 
 go and still pay tha trigga 
 me and the world turns.. 
 we bustin at tha crazed nigga 
 a loaded you will always continue to pursue me 
 all i see is snakes duck and hide from helicopters 
 we bust that ass tonight 
 now am i sick, or better yet but still pay me 
 you tell me 
 all
