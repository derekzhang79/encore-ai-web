 we come for you, all the pace 
 went off the prize, still i play it 
 you blow me in this motherfucker 
 fuck bein' tame, set to rain 
 and we can hear your style, sounds like makaveli the don 
 2pac, my nigga 
 so much caine in the silly games 
 in the citaaay of good ol' watts 
 in the city where our niggaz run the streets, fuck peace dog 
 i'm gettin lost in the madness, blunted gettin tipsy 
 hand it, get your ass 
 young thug style out this bitch, like it's a benz 
 i hit the scene somethin to my motherfuckin dope fiends 
 that getting ghost 
 
 [chorus 2x] 
 
 [2pac] 
 can you wrong niggas 'cause them a lil' child 
 it's always drama 
 whevever i wanna get it on till i die? 
 am i villian, my trials with niggas can't fade me, and maybe 
 that ain't try to mac the truth cause i'm lookin' for a sound 
 the outlaw niggas don't know me 
 everybody's always g'd up, from head 
 form japan, a boss playa with one
