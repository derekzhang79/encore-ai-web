 they can shoot me a calculated step, to bring me a gun 
 and he had me feelin like a woman scorn 
 a cemetary full of mothafuckers got not knowin'

 and watch 'em fall when i be the same life

 and uh how's that nigga when this shit died got love 
 so now i roll and we outlaws rushing you busting you
