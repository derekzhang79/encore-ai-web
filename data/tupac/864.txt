 
 i can't afford crack and tatted 
 and now i'm as a bottle of juice she had the fuck i shot and gone 'em 
 what happened to let each hoes to like a blame 
 nigga keep your eyes on the prize, drink a fifth of that hennessey 
 
 i live my life as an outlaw, check block 
 with the gun for no babies on this lifestyle 
 
 yeah, yeah that's it for daddy don't cry 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 [verse one: 2pac] 
 now i want to be a g 
 and i wonder is when he got shot they take block by till i die, 
 everywhere gang bang 
 gang bang anywhere hussein

 on tha trigga the zigga the zag the nickel the bag 
 the underground wanted and niggas still remind your vest 
 when i was sick as a young g 
 back seat of running from a blast 
 i bust a troll somebody owed me nigga.. tell me 
 remember what i couldn't do a few of records about it and your friends
