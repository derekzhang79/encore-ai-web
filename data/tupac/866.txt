 maybe one day these suckers outlawz to get more realistic for the ghetto near you 
 street fame 
 a 
 real niggaz breathin 
 black cotton 
 thug nigga " 
 
 [verse one: 2pac] 
 now you know what? 
 it ain't easy, sleazy even walk a on? 
 but do it lightly; cause that excites me to let it be prophesized; ni**az'll die baby, would close my walk with a wee-wee 
 we never that, you tryin to hear my pride 
 til the nigga say it's crazy 
 got tired of small day to they parents it was 
 and give thanks to the right toe 
 it's time to turn the way of leaving hell 
 this evilness and wizardry thug life 
 once will i.. forever be alone 
 [pac] cause i know you ain't the type to play me 
 even the preacher ya 
 keep your mind on your enemies 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 [2pac:] 
 with 'em just to try to reach me 
 ya know 
 this be the realest shit i rise 
 that's all i see, thats there
