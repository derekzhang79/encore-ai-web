 big soul of the 12 gauge 
 and i'm buckin blastin, straight mashin 
 mobbin with a soldier since a soul of leaving long nigga 
 
 just made way for me, i see 
 i don't wanna be a dead man 
 i knew my thug nigga always keep the dough 
 while i'm cold 
 getting with this man a mac up, case em' 
 cause that excites me to fight until the day i watch the test me 
 and still that don't blame us 
 we can do the world over 
 when the break you up, and still terrified, i'll get away 
 
 [chorus:] 
 hey playa cardz right as quick 
 cause i'm gettin paid 
 so when i was born alone, 30 dollars 
 told suge at hard 
 
 i'm tryin to ride on 
 and every hood i eat, look at you 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 [verse three: 2pac] 
 
 i see the same nigga 
 give me the good in the game [1] 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 [sleepy brown - over chorus second half]
