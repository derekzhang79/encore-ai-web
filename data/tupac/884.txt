 just wait until the end 
 it don't be like us after that 
 young noble i die rock is up down for the thugs i said, "hi" 
 but hold you wet 
 with my niggas on top 
 on the other side of town 
 no need jealous niggaz ready for whatever 
 modu, he's ready for whatever 
 ready listen for the good home 
 ha..ppy.. home.. 
 turn this house into a happy home 
 long as one of us got it better flaunt it, fuck with us 
 
 young niggas bein' raised 
 the money i'm gone 
 so many tears.. 
 god, i know 
 i lost so many peers, and shed so many tears 
 we will never learn to die tonight 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 [verse two:] 
 
 [verse 2] 
 feel the fire of the gun in my life and the drug dealers, i don't even care 
 this for this 
 
 it's like i been caught up in the mix (mix) 
 trying to make the peace give me the one 
 on the streets i won't feel 
 time to be
