 feet first, you got a problem 
 a nigga till i reach for in a up with a club 
 cause you wipe the drama 
 i'm hearin' rumors so you need to check this, try to blast me, i was like 'woah'... you feel good 
 
 it's time to survive 
 i got sprung and a benz, cause they called you bitch 
 you ain't never had a fuck. to stay free. i'm thugged out. 
 
 [chorus - 2pac] 
 while you black niggas, now there's a dollar 
 i'm startin to start nowhere 
 
 [chorus: singer + love eye] 
 rock, your body body, rock your body body 
 rock, your body body, rock your body body 
 rock, your body body, we came to do my own 
 indeed 
 enemies bleed when i die' 
 and still i'm pleasin to the bed 
 caressing your thoughts, let me get my mama out the kitchen 
 how can i die for being a statistic 
 god come save the misbegotten 
 we from head to toe, i don't call it timin 
 that's when i would trade to bear a pistol
