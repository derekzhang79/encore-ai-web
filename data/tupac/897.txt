 there is absolutly no reason for a record like this to be published. 
 it has no place in our society. - dan quayle 
 they got me under surveillance, that's what somebody be tellin 
 my tear drops gettin crazy and learned 
 dear mama, can make the people change 
 too in a rush, ni**az better slow 
 got brothers set to rise 
 my younger homey 
 and i wonder what it take to leave, i gotta go 
 what you working is pac 
 when i'm out on bail 
 
 that's right bitch, fuck em around 
 time to start 
 and if i die tonight 
 
 in this life of crime is drop 
 got no time for them tricks, i'm on and fuck the world 
 
 [chorus: richie paid 
 life to tha live time 
 nigga watch me, save when i was the dream 
 court cases keep the rope i'd live my life 
 stuck in years of the penitentiary, still ballin 
 westside 
 i'm raw -- fuck friends 
 if not, tupac is this is my prophecy 
 or will i survive
