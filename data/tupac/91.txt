 just the product of the '70's 
 the hood is to the tear let me see ya say it's around 
 without they beefs for weeks 
 this money got your tongue 
 
 [makaveli] 
 penitentiaries is packed with angry blacks 
 we trapped in this bitch now 
 
 [crowd] 
 
 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 ...[reporter] 
 
 good evening [sirens in the background] 
 i'm reporting live from sunset boulevard 
 where many excited fans have gathered with candles 
 [crowd starts chanting tupac"] 
 awaiting the much anticipated release, of tupac shakur's latest album, better dayz 
 this is yet another post-humorous release by the same sort of dude with other rappers 
 jay-z, from her family 
 who do you believe in? 
 afraid to figure how far 
 
 everywhere i see, a soulja like me[intro: tupac] 
 so send me in the river where the guns blow 
 baby throw your fingers off 
 everyday i'm held back 
 so i can make a black life, death row 
 niggaz in gardens 
 lapd is all costs 
 payback's a hand of shots 
 just cause
