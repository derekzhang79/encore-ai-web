 tell me to answer this (yep) 
 i don't fear death 
 can you learn to breathe, haha 
 living out a bag, but she's glad for me to heaven 
 i got nothing to me, i'm not slowing or softening 
 
 [chorus - repeat 2x] 
 
 so whats like me when i did 
 steady yellin out and put some hoes somethin to prison i take you, stay the fuck up 
 with the drama that i'm under, is just the poverty y'all niggaz got me by suprise... heard 
 i'm livin proper, the coppers is havin fun 
 with a price to be the type of fella that you get, at dope 
 but i'm a dog 
 heard i won't? 
 you tried to harm me tonight 
 'cause you the line who don't care 
 for all this time, they keep the pistol to your knot 
 now they lost they talkin street slang, but the punks still can't free 
 that's the rebel dogg full of demonstrators 
 and in they sleep 
 but what i'ma ride patiently alone 
 but do you make this one again, make
