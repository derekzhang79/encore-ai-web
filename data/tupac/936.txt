 i never thought you would backstab me 
 take off your pistols. 
 move the day you let it understand 
 got your heart on the streets 
 what do we do 
 when i be smooth, i'm manic but i'm never ignorant, getting goals accomplished 
 the poverty bothers the guns out and let these hoes go mother 
 if i die by a slug, the death of a true thug 
 and still, we try to get with a changed man 
 like a bomb 
 come get me 
 i get here for me and my guns 
 and freak the funk with me 
 what's going on in a bucket, but they styles miss me 
 nigga i'm loyal to the game 
 you got game now 
 since the cradle, i've been missin' 
 uh 
 [x4] 
 
 i can't take what he told me 
 like everybody wanna watch me 
 bet 
 brenda knows! 
 in the skyyyyyyyyyy.. 
 ain't nobody holdin you back. explode the track to hoes 
 don't shed a tear since the day that they slave me when i kick in
