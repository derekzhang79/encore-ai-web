 with candles and bubbles sipping in me 
 my baby lie here dyin' 
 and multiple rounds that's proper 
 have no intentions of becoming homies

 and count your mind to to bust out the casket, 
 getting pages from my young thugs and raised me 
 pistol packin' fresh out of jail, life's hell 
 picture you make it last 
 i made it to them 
 calvary 
 
 i got to spin the people in her city 
 but when you wipe your eyes, see it clearly 
 there's no need to put in the air 
 [chorus 2x] 
 won't ask why 
 but don't takes to me, we don't cater to ya face 
 nigga make the beat fly 
 my money and thug niggaz 
 and my first round is for the lord, too 
 
 callin' up and die 
 [t.d.] thug life! 
 [2pac] 
 lord know i ain't playing 
 i'm under pressure, and pay 'em the fuck you 
 i can hear your
