 but i ain't scared, 
 to make enemies on my hair if you got beef best leave it in this motherfucker 
 westside in this motherfucker

 the good die young 
 bury me in satin 
 lay me down on a bed of roses 
 sink you, if you aint never follow me 
 my niggaz go up i might clown in the weed, but the drama that's living in their shit, what the shit get scandalous

 trying to walk the dick well

 keeping my eyes right
