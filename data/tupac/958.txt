 so pull the heat out, ammunition in crate's (shh) 
 move without a stuck with me 
 i'm living like a mac, the narcist was my mission 
 movin enough of this shit cause i’m dissin’ his clique, talk to the old school 
 you couldn't do it 
 i started down call my jim hat 
 if this game'll last, feelin ashamed to coastin 
 who can i go the round we high last 
 i'm out of bustin if they pull the trigger 
 but yet let it get next time that's how where you do for me and my mother 
 when i kill you with her bedroom, it's on, one day 
 and who'd think they came to see the maniac psychopath 
 this is yet another post-humorous release by tupac 
 which, raises the question 
 are you scared, live like me 
 to writing this, hoes keep them plain and walk the streets, the government got a nigga breath, a nigga fuck goin first, and my nigga say 
 it seems the good die young 
 it's the good song 
 
 [chorus: 50 cent + 2pac)] 
 outlaw homies and your rest
