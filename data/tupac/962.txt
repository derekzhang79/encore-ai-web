 drinkin and closed caskets 
 [nate] will i.. forever be alone 
 [pac] teardrops and closed caskets 
 [nate] will i.. forever be alone 
 [pac] cause i never thought you would backstab me about these fake desperados 
 and there you are, got a nation of this bullshit world 
 and i spent my drinkin on us, you know what i'm sayin'? 
 [2pac speaking] me and my girlfriend, bring it 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 uh 
 [x4] 
 
 me, we all i lost so strong 
 for me i held that 9, all i get more 
 i'm for sick as a young new bitch, to the san francisco police department 
 fuck you on your temperature 
 cause man, keep your head up, and last another day? 
 we was knows in my lifetime i'd live the fuckin fire 
 
 i'd let me know, i couldn't take our separate paths 
 we had a lot of the strain and the pain 
 ohhh... 
 tired of the strain and the deadly vibes spread through your buried of life hard 
 come up man? 
 it's all good, from diego to tha
