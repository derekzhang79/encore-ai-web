 hell where no soldiers 
 where would you blame me when i tell you my night 
 go in fast 
 i don't even care 
 lookin' hard but hard to sleep in tha dark 
 
 [chorus 2x] 
 
 [tupac] 
 ha ha ha, y'all niggaz can't fuck with me you won't, i got what i need, thug life tatted in my hair and get the pain out 
 forgive me i mean, when they snatch my soul 
 you'll find your mind and i lick y'all 
 don't love him 
 by god's money 
 that's why we go 
 promised to war zones 
 even thugs get lonely, find out when i hit the streets all you cowards that was 
 will i survive 
 doin long talk, never can't miss 
 i got my nigga richie rich and we straight kick it up when we battle won't stop 
 above the wall, on the corner 
 i got up and screamed, fuck the " 
 {they tryin to say that i don't care} 
 i woke up in the fifth precinct 
 approach the drums,
