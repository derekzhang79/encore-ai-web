 can't you see it? 
 who makes the call will i fall as hell 
 now they wonder why my niggaz, do! 
 i hate to spend my life, my life, my life, my life, my life, my life, my life, my life, my life 
 duckin' one time 
 just wait until the rain turn to sunshine 
 'cause i hate to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind 
 so i can live or die 
 when another doubts i was hear my mother shout.. 
 in the first one on the block to be the first to smack a flow 
 gang bang anywhere hussein ain't nobody tell me 
 do i walk around when you see me close 
 i nervous, remember " 
 talk it ain't no need for rushin' you to bust the same why tu'? cause takes 
 got a glock, and i clock grip 
 better watch he live 
 bye bye, i was never meant to live 
 can't be positive, when the shit happens, it don't phase me 
 and i don't want you to cry 
 what do you catch man?
