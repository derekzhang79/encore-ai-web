 cause they hate when daddy last told

 sue sign 
 but that's the game

 lost in the wild life 
 criminal lyrics on hitting the heat,

 lil' trigga for the lord, why cry 
 floatin in this muthafucka 
 i hope you got your head up

 play me, they left your back don't be down 
 i hate to spend my life,
