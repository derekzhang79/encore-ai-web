 [verse three: 2pac] 
 
 i can't explain that i'm here for violence 
 and the streets i'm gone 
 we walk the streets 
 til the niggaz from the underground 
 and i gotta take a fatter track, get a bite to eat

 love the way you get, and watch him close 
 wrapped in plastic 
 met the law give a damn about a ne-gro 
 pull a trigger kill a nigger he's a fuckin free

 introduced you to be my homie til this dead drop 
 and pimps be out to put down my guard, tryin to where of deadly g
