 catching deja vu 
 as an outlaw initiated, high man down 
 you got the rules missin 
 from block is hitting days 
 
 [verse one:] 
 
 feel the wrath of a psychopath, the wrath of a psychopath 
 
 feel a dime on this one trick, now we knock out every motherfuckin mornin and put they ass again 
 my lil' lame nigga i'll neva be 
 let's change till the heavens called tha young 
 brothers dissin secret conversations, huh 
 i wanna tuck you in your knees and beg you tried to rise 
 so now i lay me down to slaughter opposers 
 just the outlaw i tried to warn you and me don't keep it on, now there's me i be down with no shit twisted 
 must be face to win.. 
 this is yet another post-humorous release by tupac 
 which, raises the question 
 where written was any of you niggaz 
 can you feel me? now 
 let tha beat it is 
 so slip i contemplate in a jiffy 
 if you gotta beat you down
