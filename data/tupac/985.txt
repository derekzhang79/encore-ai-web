 then whaddya know, it's comin' loose. 
 see me nigga, watch a clip 
 and i can't breathe, cause i'm up to the slots where the time more flips more trips more stamps on police give me up so clean of me 
 i'm goin deep, it's the morning and i ask myself, 
 i'm a dog like he can make the shit 
 and my man at all, long as you just bring me your in and the nigga, and we are unstoppable 
 and rich niggaz 
 they call me storm with your name at times 
 i drop degrees [echo] 
 cause i'm gettin paid 
 gets around and we the last 
 all is, played our foes 
 niggaz is callin cops, people shot, nobody stops 
 i got sprung and it's mind blowin, so i'm transportin weight 
 sipping henney for daddy watch me hit the scene 
 when will the hoochies was starin, to hell 
 don't expect me to be a perfect person cuz i'm a do what i'm a do. 
 i am still thirsty - arrested development 
 there is absolutly no reason
