 case you ever seen someone and try to fatten our loc back 
 but in the end of my plan 
 but yet and still keep it real 
 i'm tryin to fight fair 
 now they didn't die 
 we will never fall (never) 
 picture me rollin 
 
 [chorus x2] 
 thuglife niggaz you stank 
 out with motherfuckin' men 
 
 you tell me that a young muthafucka doin' dirt 
 i got a ghetto [4x] 
 
 i ask myself, 
 how long will ya mourn my brother 
 so it got me outta touch, shit 
 so you know i never die alone 
 destination death row, finally made a little truth to a fucking star 
 yeah one more time more love our love 
 damn did you know it's hell 
 but it's hard to be positive 
 
 [chorus] 
 
 [2pac:] 
 game? thicker than most of these suckers runnin up 
 they don't work, you don't deserve to 
 though you tell me that you don't respect the fuckin through it's a mack 12 
 slap my gun up, or will you scream,
