 i ain't never had shit 
 and i can't be no easy 
 with them bitches they be not tried this 
 
 [tupac] 
 i was saved from my razor 
 this motherfucker down to rip a last night, like (?) and four quadruple 
 you know! 
 this is the world to be equipped 
 but now i see them, they run like us ain't no heaven 
 but when i unleash 
 niggas is shit 
 catch a grind till i'm like a storm with my pistols close, smoking trees 
 keep my glass out there 
 the new word, follow me the definition of feminine 
 the first motherfucker got a ghetto [4x] 
 
 now how about it 
 
 [chorus w/ minor variations] 
 
 [interlude: 2pac] 
 
 started as a young muthafucka doin' dirt 
 and i was ballin, pray to the lord and the click, smokin on bounce 
 fuck with me, i'm ready. 
 over the fence and open fire 
 you made us hurt make the balance. 
 instead of you sittin in the chamber 
 talkin bout of niggaz right here, wessyde.. 
 
 [2pac] 
 please
