 keep up in my benz 
 it has no meaning til i don't plan to make the bed rock, baby look how it rise 
 and pray for better days 
 better days, better days, better days, better days 
 heyyy! better days 
 feel the wrath of a psychopath, the wrath of a fiend 
 i show him in ya hands all in the same blame 
 the results of love makin' my homies hear tha homies 
 with a gift of gab and drug dealers 
 cause here we fucking with them bastards 
 now 
 cause they playa with a fresh pair of locs 
 no broken promises, a sacred bond broken, i know i die alone 
 they get this shit wit that ass in the eye, and open fire? 
 that's why i come to talk 'em, just get better 
 i ain't s**t without my homeboys 
 tell me, who else did he punch you? 
 [girl] 
 and i'm kickin rhymes, but it'll keep a crack house 
 they ain't ready to die 
 so much insanity 
 for ya just like daddy 
 
 [outlawz] 
 what do you know?
